This population is distributed unevenly across 50 states. Generally, states that are around the country&#x2019;s border &#x2013; West Coast, East Coast, and southern states &#x2013; are the most populous. States that are more interior, such as those in the Great Plains and Midwest, tend to be less populous. However, there are some exceptions, such as Illinois, which is in the Midwest but has a high population, mainly centered in the <a href="/us-cities/chicago-population/" target="_blank">Chicago</a> area.</p></div><div style="text-align:justify"><p>By far, the most populous state in the United States is California. It has nearly 40 million residents, comprising a whopping 12% of the country&#x2019;s population. If California were a country, it would have the eighth largest economy in the world and the 36th highest population! </p></div><div style="text-align:justify"><p>Next in line is Texas, which has about 29 million residents; however, Texas has a growth rate of 1.34% per year, while California&#x2019;s growth rate is less than half of that at 0.48%. Since 2010, the population of Texas has increased by over 15%! After California and Texas comes Florida, with a population of about 21.5 million. It is also growing rapidly, with a growth rate of 1.63% per year. </p></div><div style="text-align:justify"><p>On the East Coast, the most populous state is New <a href="/world-cities/york-population/" target="_blank">York</a>, which is the fourth most populous in the country. Out of a population of 20 million, about half of its residents live in <a href="/us-cities/new-york-city-population/" target="_blank">New York City</a>. States in <a href="/regions/new-england-population/" target="_blank">New England</a>, along the Northeast seaboard, tend to be quite small geographically but with higher populations. Rhode Island is the smallest state by land mass, but it has a higher population than many larger states, including Alaska (the largest state by land mass), Montana, and Wyoming. Montana, though it has a vastly larger land mass than Rhode Island, has 10,000 fewer residents.</p></div><div style="text-align:justify"><p>The smallest state by population is Wyoming, with fewer than 600,000 residents and a negative growth rate of almost 1% per year. Other states with negative population growths include <a href="/states/louisiana-population/" target="_blank">Louisiana</a>, <a href="/states/connecticut-population/" target="_blank">Connecticut</a>, <a href="/states/kansas-population/" target="_blank">Kansas</a>, <a href="/states/west-virginia-population/" target="_blank">West Virginia</a>, <a href="/states/hawaii-population/" target="_blank">Hawaii</a>, Rhode Island, and Alaska. Surprisingly, despite the presence of the massive cities of New York City and Chicago, both New York and Illinois are experiencing negative population growths. <a href="/countries/puerto-rico-population/" target="_blank">Puerto Rico</a> is not a state, but it is also experiencing negative population growth. </p></div><div style="text-align:justify"><p>Most states are currently experiencing population growth, the greatest of which can be seen in <a href="/states/idaho-population/" target="_blank">Idaho</a>, at over 2%. States that have a lot of tech jobs that employ young people, such as <a href="/states/washington-population/" target="_blank">Washington</a> State and California,  are experiencing

<p>The 2010 census concluded that the state of Alabama had a population of 4,785,448, which increased in the 2018 assessment by 2.36% to 4,887,871 people. The most recent estimates that Alabamaâs 2019 population has grown an additional 0.21% to 4,898,246 people. With this estimate, Alabama comprises approximately 1.47% of the entire US population.</p>
<p>Alabamaâs population places it at the 24th most populated state in the <a href='/countries/united-states-population/' target='_blank'>United States</a> with an above-average density of 97 people per square mile. <a href='/us-cities/montgomery-population/' target='_blank'>Montgomery</a>, the state capital, has shown slow yet consistent growth in population and currently is home to approximately 205,000 people. However, the largest city in Alabama by population is <a href='/us-cities/birmingham-population/' target='_blank'>Birmingham</a>. </p>
<h2 id="a-hrefstatesalaska-population-target_blankalaskaa"><a href='/states/alaska-population/' target='_blank'>Alaska</a></h2>
<p>Alaska is a unique state due to its unusual daylight schedule and extreme cold. Though it is the largest state in area, it is nearly the least populated state at 735,720 people. That means it only makes up 0.22% of the entire US population! To give you more detail, the area of Alaska is 663,267 square miles, and the next largest state is <a href='/states/texas-population/' target='_blank'>Texas</a>, at 268,581 square miles. The only area in the US less populated than Alaska is the District of <a href='/us-cities/columbia-population/' target='_blank'>Columbia</a>, with the difference being less than 25,000 people! The largest city in Alaska, <a href='/us-cities/anchorage-population/' target='_blank'>Anchorage</a>, houses over 40% of the total Alaskan population.</p>
<p>The state of Alaska is one of 11 that have seen a decline in its growth in its 2019 population, though its overall growth since the 2010 census indicates an increase of approximately 3.06% from 713,906 people. The drop is measured to be 0.23%, bringing the population down from 737, 438 in 2018. </p>
<h2 id="a-hrefstatesarizona-population-target_blankarizonaa"><a href='/states/arizona-population/' target='_blank'>Arizona</a></h2>
<p>The latest census estimates the population of Arizona to be around 7,275,070 people in 2019, indicating a growth rate of about 1.44% from the 2018 population of 7,171,646 people. Arizona has seen significant growth since the 2010 census, with figures demonstrating a 13.54% growth rate. This figure makes Arizona the fourth fastest growing state of 2018. </p>
<p>Between July 2017 and July 2018, Maricopa County added over 81,000 people, equal to more than 200 people per day. Home to cities including <a href='/us-cities/phoenix-population/' target='_blank'>Phoenix</a>, <a href='/us-cities/mesa-population/' target='_blank'>Mesa</a>, <a href='/us-cities/chandler-population/' target='_blank'>Chandler</a>, <a href='/us-cities/scottsdale-population/' target='_blank'>Scottsdale</a>, <a href='/us-cities/tempe-population/' target='_blank'>Tempe</a>, <a href='/us-cities/glendale-population/' target='_blank'>Glendale</a>, and many more, Maricopa County was the fourth most populated county in the US and attracted more net migration than any other county in the US. Despite this growth, Arizona still has a below-average population density of 64 people per square mile. </p>
<h2 id="a-hrefstatesarkansas-population-target_blankarkansasa"><a href='/states/arkansas-population/' target='_blank'>Arkansas</a></h2>
<p>Arkansas, with a name derived from the Siouan Quapaw Indians, is a landlocked state with diverse geography spanning the mountainous regions of the Ozarks to the forests of the Arkansas Timberlands, to the lowlands of the <a href='/states/mississippi-population/' target='_blank'>Mississippi</a> River and the Arkansas Delta.</p>
<p>Based on the 2010 census, Arkansas has grown 3.57% in population from 2.9 million people to 3,013,825 in 2018 and 3,026,412 people in 2019. The population density is below average at 58 people per square mile, making Arkansas the 34th most populated state in the country. <a href='/us-cities/little-rock-population/' target='_blank'>Little Rock</a> serves as the stateâs capital and is the stateâs largest city in terms of population, with almost 200,000 residents. </p>
<h2 id="a-hrefstatescalifornia-population-target_blankcaliforniaa"><a href='/states/california-population/' target='_blank'>California</a></h2>
<p>California is the most populated state in the US, boasting a population of 39,747,267 people and making up almost 12% of the entire nationâs population. Since the 2010 census, California has experienced a 6.5% growth rate. The Golden State has an extremely dense population for its size and is ranked the 13th highest population dense state, with 255 people per square mile. The Greater <a href='/us-cities/los-angeles-population/' target='_blank'>Los Angeles</a> Area and the <a href='/us-cities/san-francisco-population/' target='_blank'>San Francisco</a> Bay Area are the nationâs 2nd and 5th most populated urban areas respectively, with 18.7 million and 9.7 million residents. Los Angeles is Californiaâs most heavily populated city and the United Statesâ second most populated city after <a href='/us-cities/new-york-city-population/' target='_blank'>New York City</a>. </p>
<p>The state of California has an economy larger than that of any other state and is the second-largest sub-national economy in the world after <a href='/world-cities/sao-paulo-population/' target='_blank'>Sao Paulo</a> in <a href='/countries/brazil-population/' target='_blank'>Brazil</a>. California is bordered by <a href='/states/oregon-population/' target='_blank'>Oregon</a>, <a href='/states/nevada-population/' target='_blank'>Nevada</a>, Arizona, and Baja California and is on the Western coast of the US, overlooking the Pacific Ocean.  </p>
<h2 id="a-hrefstatescolorado-population-target_blankcoloradoa"><a href='/states/colorado-population/' target='_blank'>Colorado</a></h2>
<p>Located at the heart of the Rocky Mountains, the Centennial State has seen considerable growth since the 2010 census numbers. Its 2018 population grew by 14.31% to 5,695,564 people from 5,048,281 in 2010. The growth trend continues, as 2019 saw another 1.32% increase in the population to over 5.7 million. This current trend is even threatening to cause housing shortages and increased traffic! 
Despite this growth, Colorado still has a below average population density even though the state itself is the eighth largest state in the USA. The harsh terrain and climate as well as the vast Rocky Mountain range are most likely the rationale for this figure.  </p>
<h2 id="a-hrefstatesconnecticut-population-target_blankconnecticuta"><a href='/states/connecticut-population/' target='_blank'>Connecticut</a></h2>
<p>Situated along the Eastern seaboard, Connecticut is one of the six states that comprise the American â<a href='/regions/new-england-population/' target='_blank'>New England</a>.â This state is a rare case that has experienced consistent decreases in population since the 2010 census. There are only three other cases like this: <a href='/states/illinois-population/' target='_blank'>Illinois</a>, <a href='/states/west-virginia-population/' target='_blank'>West Virginia</a>, and the territory of <a href='/countries/puerto-rico-population/' target='_blank'>Puerto Rico</a>. 
Connecticutâs decrease in growth rate has been gradual, though the population has shrunk from 3,579,125 in 2010 to 3,567,871 in 2019. The state does have an extremely high population density for its size, however; its 737 people per square mile are far above the average 87 per square mile.  This figure is surprising considering the state is ranked 48th out of 50 for smallest area. </p>
<h2 id="a-hrefstatesdelaware-population-target_blankdelawarea"><a href='/states/delaware-population/' target='_blank'>Delaware</a></h2>
<p>Delaware, the smallest state second only to <a href='/states/rhode-island-population/' target='_blank'>Rhode Island</a>, is home to less than one million individuals. According to the 2018 census, Delawareâs population increased from 899,595 in 2010 to 967,171 in 2018, then to 975,033 based on the 2019 census. Though Delaware is small, its population density is far above the 87 people per square mile; in this little state, there are 500 people every square mile. There are only 1,982 square miles throughout the entire state. Although Dover is the capital, the largest city is <a href='/us-cities/wilmington-population/' target='_blank'>Wilmington</a>. 
Alaska and Delaware are comparable in their population size: 0.22% and 0.29% of the U.S. respectively, though their population densities and the size of the states are wildly different.</p>
<h2 id="the-district-of-columbia">The District of Columbia</h2>
<p>The District of Columbia, or informally known as <a href='/states/washington-population/' target='_blank'>Washington</a>, D.C., is the capital of the United States. The word âDistrictâ refers to the area created that is not technically a state but is a federal designation. For statistical purposes, the census bureau treats the District of Columbia as a state-equivalent. This area is unique in that commuters from surrounding <a href='/states/maryland-population/' target='_blank'>Maryland</a> and <a href='/states/virginia-population/' target='_blank'>Virginia</a> suburbs raise the cityâs daytime population to more than one million during the workweek, though the actual residential population according to the 2019 census is 711,571. This number shows small growth of 1.3% from the 2018 population of 702,455. </p>
<p>Washington, D.C., has the highest population density in the country of 11,665 people per square mile based on its very small area. </p>
<h2 id="a-hrefstatesflorida-population-target_blankfloridaa"><a href='/states/florida-population/' target='_blank'>Florida</a></h2>
<p>Florida is the third most populous state in the nation, with 21,646,155 people according to the 2019 census. This figure indicates over 15% growth since the 2010 census estimate of 18,845,785 people. Floridaâs many beaches and warm climate make it the state a trendy spot for vacations and those who want to live in that matter all year long. The Sunshine State is so loved that the census projections for 2020 place the Floridian population at over 22 million. </p>
<p><a href='/us-cities/jacksonville-population/' target='_blank'>Jacksonville</a> alone has a population of over 900,000 people, which is more than the populations of <a href='/states/wyoming-population/' target='_blank'>Wyoming</a>, <a href='/states/north-dakota-population/' target='_blank'>North Dakota</a>, <a href='/states/south-dakota-population/' target='_blank'>South Dakota</a>, Alaska, <a href='/states/vermont-population/' target='_blank'>Vermont</a>, and the District of Columbia. <a href='/us-cities/tallahassee-population/' target='_blank'>Tallahassee</a>, the state capital, has a population of almost 200,000 people. The population density in the state of Florida, which is 404 people per square mile, is over 4.5 times the national average.</p>
<h2 id="a-hrefcountriesgeorgia-population-target_blankgeorgiaa"><a href='/countries/georgia-population/' target='_blank'>Georgia</a></h2>
<p><a href='/states/georgia-population/' target='_blank'>Georgia</a> is the largest state east of the Mississippi River. It is the eighth-most populated state in the US with a current estimate of 10.63 million residents, surpassing <a href='/states/michigan-population/' target='_blank'>Michigan</a>âs rank as number eight and representing approximately 3.2% of the American populace. </p>
<p>Located in the southeastern corner of the North American continent, Georgia is the 21st largest state in total size (by land area). Its population density is above average at around 185 people per square mile, with the average being around 87. The most populated city in Georgia is <a href='/us-cities/atlanta-population/' target='_blank'>Atlanta</a>. Its most populated county is Fulton County with over one million residents, making it almost twice the population of Wyoming. The state of Georgia is divided into 159 counties in total; that amount is almost more than any other state except for Texas, which has 254 counties. Georgiaâs least populated county is Taliferro County, with only 1608 people living in the entire 195 square miles. </p>
<h2 id="a-hrefstateshawaii-population-target_blankhawaiia"><a href='/states/hawaii-population/' target='_blank'>Hawaii</a></h2>
<p>Hawaiiâs population is currently estimated at around 1,416,589, making it the 41st most populated state in the US. This estimate actually represents a 0.27% decrease from the 2018 estimate of 1,420,491. There are eight major islands in Hawaii: <a href='/regions/oahu-population/' target='_blank'>Oahu</a>, Hawaii, <a href='/regions/maui-population/' target='_blank'>Maui</a>, Molokai, Lanai, Niihau, and Kahoolawe. All are populated except for the last. <a href='/us-cities/honolulu-population/' target='_blank'>Honolulu</a> is the largest city and county in Hawaii, claiming nearly 350,399 people of Oahu on its own. </p>
<p>Hawaii is also home to the smallest county in the US: Kalawao County. Kalawao County has a landmass of a mere 13.21 square miles and is considered the smallest administrative unit in the United States that can be considered a county. It has a population of 88! Though Hawaii is small, it is a beautiful and desirable land, which accounts for its high population density: 221 people per square mile across its 10,931 square miles.</p>
<h2 id="a-hrefstatesidaho-population-target_blankidahoa"><a href='/states/idaho-population/' target='_blank'>Idaho</a></h2>
<p>Idaho is one of the largest states in the US, though its population does not match its landmass. With a population density of only 22 people per square mile for all 82,747 square miles of it, Idaho is only home to approximately 1.79 million US residents. Only six other states in the US have a lower population density than this: Alaska, Wyoming, <a href='/states/montana-population/' target='_blank'>Montana</a>, North and South Dakota, and <a href='/states/new-mexico-population/' target='_blank'>New Mexico</a>. The current population also reflects growth from 2018 of about 2.05%, from 1.75 million. </p>
<p>Idahoâs sparse population can be attributed to the Rocky Mountains and expansive lakes, as well as Hellâs Canyon, which is deeper than the Grand Canyon at 7,900 feet. The most populated city in Idaho is the capital city, <a href='/us-cities/boise-population/' target='_blank'>Boise</a>, at around 218,281 people. The least populated city in Idaho, Warm River, has a staggering population of three.</p>
<h2 id="illinois">Illinois</h2>
<p>The Illinois population is estimated to be about 12,700,381 people as of 2019, indicating a negative growth rate of 0.32% from 2018âs estimate of 12,741,080. Surprisingly, Illinois is one of the four states that have shown a decrease from the 2010 consensus and the 2018 consensus. This state saw immense growth throughout the 19th century, but despite its current decrease in population, Illinois remains the sixth most populated state in the U.S. </p>
<p>The total area of Illinois is over 57,900 square miles with a population density of 230 people per square mile, though most of the population is heavily concentrated in the northeastern area of the state, in the metropolitan area of <a href='/us-cities/chicago-population/' target='_blank'>Chicago</a>. Chicagoâs population is approximately 2.72 million people, which is close to the size of the entire state of <a href='/states/kansas-population/' target='_blank'>Kansas</a>. The smallest county in Illinois, Hardin County, is home to 3,910 people. </p>
<h2 id="a-hrefstatesindiana-population-target_blankindianaa"><a href='/states/indiana-population/' target='_blank'>Indiana</a></h2>
<p>Indiana, the Hoosier state, known for its rustic individualism, shares its northern border with Michigan, eastern border with <a href='/states/ohio-population/' target='_blank'>Ohio</a>, the southern and southeastern border with <a href='/states/kentucky-population/' target='_blank'>Kentucky</a>, and western border with Illinois. It is estimated to have a population of about 6,718,616, demonstrating a growth rate of around 0.4% from the 2018 estimate and making up just over 2% of the U.S. population as a whole. </p>
<p>The state of Indiana covers 36,418 square miles, making it the 38th largest state by land area; however, its population makes it the 16th most densely populated state in the country, with a population density of 181 people per square mile. The largest city in Indiana is its capital, <a href='/us-cities/indianapolis-population/' target='_blank'>Indianapolis</a>, with over 863,700 residents, making it more populated than North Dakota on its own. Indianaâs smallest city is Liberty, with a population of only 2,061 residents as of 2019. </p>
<h2 id="a-hrefstatesiowa-population-target_blankiowaa"><a href='/states/iowa-population/' target='_blank'>Iowa</a></h2>
<p>Located in the Midwestern United States, Iowa shares its borders with <a href='/states/wisconsin-population/' target='_blank'>Wisconsin</a>, Illinois, <a href='/states/missouri-population/' target='_blank'>Missouri</a>, <a href='/states/nebraska-population/' target='_blank'>Nebraska</a>, South Dakota, and <a href='/states/minnesota-population/' target='_blank'>Minnesota</a>. The state has 99 counties and is the 31st most populated state in the U.S, though it is the 23rd largest state by landmass.</p>
<p>Iowaâs 2010 census estimated a population of 3,050,767, while the most recent estimates indicate a growth rate of about 3.84% with a current population of 3,167,997. Iowaâs population is sparse, with a population density below average: 57 people per square mile as opposed to the average of 87 people per square mile. The low population density can be ascribed to the large farmland areas in the state. Because the stateâs economy is mainly agriculture-based, Iowaâs farmlands are in high demand.</p>
<p>The state capital, <a href='/us-cities/des-moines-population/' target='_blank'>Des Moines</a>, is the most populated city in the state, with a population over 217,400 people, and was once designated as the Wealthiest City in America. Urbana, Iowa, however, is the smallest city in the state and houses less than 1,500 residents.</p>
<h2 id="kansas">Kansas</h2>
<p>Located nearly in the center of the United States, Kansas is estimated to have a population of approximately 2.9 million people. This number shows a slight growth rate of about 1.8% from the 2010 estimated population of 2.85 million, making it the 36th most populated state. In terms of landmass, however, Kansas is the 13th largest state, covering over 81,800 square miles. Considering this population and landmass, Kansasâs population density of nearly half the nationâs average should not come as a surprise. </p>
<p>The state actually has over 6,000 ghost towns due to the migration from the countryside to the cities, also known as rural flight. The metropolitan cities, however, are quickly growing. <a href='/us-cities/wichita-population/' target='_blank'>Wichita</a>, for example, boasts a population of almost 400,000 residents and is home to the statesâ largest airport: Wichita Dwight D. Eisenhower National Airport. </p>
<h2 id="kentucky">Kentucky</h2>
<p>Kentucky, which was previously a part of Virginia, became its own territory and has now grown and developed to become the 26th most populated state in the U.S. with a population of 4,484,047 people. This number represents an approximate growth of 3.12% from the 2010 census estimated population.</p>
<p>Also known as the Bluegrass State, Kentucky is the 36th largest state in area, covering 39,728 square miles. The population density of 114 people per square mile indicates an above-average density that is surprisingly equal across rural and urban areas, though rural areas experience higher levels of poverty throughout the state. </p>
<p>The counties in Kentucky show an interesting mix of growth and decline, though the state shows an overall growth rate in terms of population. The largest county, Jefferson County, shows a growth rate of 3.84%, which is close to the stateâs overall growth rate from 2010 of 3.12%. Scott County showed the most substantial growth rate of 18.51% with a population size of 56,000. However, the county with the most significant decline was Martin County with a decrease of 12.31%, though its population is only 11,323 and not likely to profoundly impact the overall state population.</p>
<h2 id="a-hrefstateslouisiana-population-target_blanklouisianaa"><a href='/states/louisiana-population/' target='_blank'>Louisiana</a></h2>
<p>Situated on the Gulf of <a href='/countries/mexico-population/' target='_blank'>Mexico</a>, in the Mississippi River Delta, Louisiana is home to approximately 4,652,581 people as of 2019, spread across 64 parishes. It is the 25th largest state in the United States in terms of population. Despite the capital being <a href='/us-cities/baton-rouge-population/' target='_blank'>Baton Rouge</a>, the city of <a href='/us-cities/new-orleans-population/' target='_blank'>New Orleans</a> is the largest regarding both population and area size.</p>
<p>Though the population rate for the state of Louisiana has increased by 2.38% since the nationwide census in 2010 from a population of approximately 4,544,532 to 4,659,978 in 2018, the growth did decrease slightly in 2019 by 0.159%. These current calculations equate to 108 people per square mile, which is higher than the US average of 87 people per square mile. However, only 11 out of the 52 regions, counting DC and the territory of <a href='/states/puerto-rico-population/' target='_blank'>Puerto Rico</a>, decreased in population from 2018 to 2019, including Louisiana.</p>
<h2 id="a-hrefstatesmaine-population-target_blankmainea"><a href='/states/maine-population/' target='_blank'>Maine</a></h2>
<p>Sitting at the most northeastern tip of the U.S., Maine, or the Pine Tree State, is one of the top ten least populated states in the U.S., though it has shown slight growth over the last ten years. The population of Maine is estimated to be 1,342,097 people, up about 1.09% from the 2010 census estimate. </p>
<p>Its natural landscape of mountains and a rocky coastline can easily explain the low population density of almost half the nationâs average: Maineâs 44 people per square mile to the average of 87 people. This figure does make it the least densely populated state in New England, however.</p>
<p>Over half of the stateâs population resides in the <a href='/us-cities/portland-population/' target='_blank'>Portland</a> metropolitan area, accounting for nearly 70,000 residents. The smallest city, Eastport, is actually the easternmost city in the United States. It has just over 1,200 residents and consists almost entirely of islands connected by causeways.</p>
<h2 id="maryland">Maryland</h2>
<p>Maryland may be one of the smallest states in the country, but it is certainly no small matter. It may not have the size, but it makes up for it in population size and density. With an estimated 6.06 million people, Maryland is the 19th most populated state in the U.S. over a mere 9,774 square miles. This figure accounts for a population density of 625 people per square mile â over seven times the national average! This state is the 7th densest population distribution in the U.S. The tiny stateâs population hasnât stopped growing, either: population projections show an estimate of 6.3 million by 2020. </p>
<p>The state is divided into 23 counties, 16 of which border tidal water. The most populated county is Montgomery Country, with over a million people residing and a growth rate of 7.81% since 2010. The entire county, for comparison, has the same population as the whole state of Rhode Island. Rhode Island has about one-sixth of the people as Maryland but is only about one-tenth of its size in landmass. </p>
<h2 id="a-hrefstatesmassachusetts-population-target_blankmassachusettsa"><a href='/states/massachusetts-population/' target='_blank'>Massachusetts</a></h2>
<p>Despite being the 6th smallest state in the country in size, Massachusetts is one of the most populated states in the U.S. Its population is estimated to be around 6.94 million, up from the 6.54 million estimate from the 2010 census.</p>
<p>The tiny stateâs population does a great job of covering every available inch of its 7,840 square miles of land, as its population density of 890 people per square mile is over 10 times the national average! Massachusetts alone makes up for about 2.09% of the U.S. population, making it the most populous of the New England states and the fastest growing one as well.</p>
<p>Massachusetts classifies its municipalities as cities or towns, and with this structure, the smallest town in the state is Gosnold in Dukes County with a population of only 75 people. <a href='/us-cities/boston-population/' target='_blank'>Boston</a>, the capital, is fittingly the most populated city with an estimated population of 694,784.</p>
<h2 id="michigan">Michigan</h2>
<p>Surrounded by the Great Lakes, Michigan is a Midwestern state and the only U.S. state to consist of two peninsulas. As of 2019, this state had an estimated population of 10.02 million people and accounted for about 3% of the U.S. population, showing a population growth rate of approximately 1.45% from 2010âs figure of 9,877,535.
Michiganâs population is somewhat dense, with an average of 177 people per square mile, making it the 20th most densely populated state.</p>
<p>The largest city in Michigan is <a href='/us-cities/detroit-population/' target='_blank'>Detroit</a>, the Motor City, with a population of around 662,000 people. Unfortunately, due to a failing automobile-based economy, Detroit has been experiencing urban decay at an exponential rate. Many of the residents leaving the city do not actually leave the state; they move to the suburbs, though the figures do undeniably show some residents leaving the state altogether.</p>
<h2 id="minnesota">Minnesota</h2>
<p>Located in the northern Midwest of the United States, Minnesotaâs population is estimated to be around 5,655,925 in 2019. The last confirmed population numbers were in 2010âs census, with a population of 5,310,843, indicating a population growth of 6.5%. </p>
<p>The stateâs population density is surprisingly below average at 71 people per square mile as opposed to the average of 87, though that may be attributed to the states large surface area: 79,610 square miles. Minnesotaâs geography also contributes to a lower population density than average, considering the large bodies of water and mountainous regions across its landscape. About 60% of the population resides within the <a href='/us-cities/minneapolis-population/' target='_blank'>Minneapolis</a>-St. Paul metropolitan area, with the remaining 40% dispersed across the rest of the counties and rural areas of the state. The least populated city in Minnesota is Rush City, with a population of only 3,186 residents.</p>
<h2 id="mississippi">Mississippi</h2>
<p>Located in the southeastern region of the United States, Mississippi is the 35th most populated state with 2,987,895 people. That estimate shows an approximate growth of 0.58% since 2010. Mississippiâs population density of 64 people per square mile is below the national average of 87, as the state residents tend to be widely spread and live in mostly rural areas. The state is bordered by <a href='/states/tennessee-population/' target='_blank'>Tennessee</a>, Alabama, Louisiana, Arkansas, and the Gulf of Mexico.</p>
<p><a href='/us-cities/jackson-population/' target='_blank'>Jackson</a>, the state capital, is the only city in Mississippi with a population above 100,000, and the most populated county in the state has been decreasing in size since 2010. Areas with populations of up to 300 are classified as villages, and Mississippi has one named Satartia with only 55 inhabitants. The main reason the state is losing population, though there is not a discernible growth rate decrease, is due to the attractiveness of job markets elsewhere.</p>
<h2 id="missouri">Missouri</h2>
<p>The landlocked state of Missouri is bordered by eight other states: Iowa, Illinois, Kentucky, Tennessee, Arkansas, <a href='/states/oklahoma-population/' target='_blank'>Oklahoma</a>, Kansas, and Nebraska. It covers 68,886 square miles and has an estimated population of 6,147,861 people, providing an approximate population density near the national average of 87 people per square mile. Missouri has experienced a 2.53% growth rate in population since the 2010 census estimate and is projected to reach 6.8 million in 2030.</p>
<p>Missouriâs current population estimate ranks it as the 18th most populated state in the country, though the population is unevenly spread. The large urban areas have a population density that can reach over 5,000 people per square mile! Missouri does also have a higher rural population than average, with approximately a third of its inhabitants living in rural areas. <a href='/us-cities/kansas-city-population/' target='_blank'>Kansas City</a>, Missouriâs largest city, is the sixth-largest city in the Midwest and has an estimated population of about 501,094. The state has seven counties under 5,000 residents: Worth County, Mercer County, Knox County, and Holt County. They have all seen decreases in population since 2010, with Holt County seeing the most dramatic decline at -10.4%.</p>
<h2 id="montana">Montana</h2>
<p>Montana, one of the âBig Sky Countryâ states, is one of the countyâs top ten least populated states, with an approximate population of 1,074,532. It has experienced a significant growth rate since the 2010 census of 8.46%, though it remains sparsely populated. Its population density is the third smallest in the country, at a shocking three people per square mile. This low population density can be attributed to its geography, which is largely unsuitable to development.</p>
<p>Montana is the only US state to share borders with three Canadian provinces: Alberta, British Columbia, and Saskatchewan. Counties with 6 or fewer people per square mile are designated as frontier counties, and forty-six of Montanaâs fifty-six counties fall into this category.</p>
<p>There are a few large urban areas in the state, and they seem to be growing quickly, while the rural areas are slowly becoming less populated. This trend is a common trend in many states. The largest city in Montana is <a href='/us-cities/billings-population/' target='_blank'>Billings</a>, home to 110,668 residents. The smallest city, which could be technically classified as a village, is Ismay, with 21 people in residence.</p>
<h2 id="nebraska">Nebraska</h2>
<p>Nebraska is the fifteenth largest state by land area and the 38th most populated state in the country. It covers 76,872 square miles and is home to 1.94 million residents, indicating a growth rate of around 6.09% since the 2010 census. 89% of Nebraskaâs cities have less than 3,000 people, which is similar to five other Midwestern states, but many of Nebraskaâs towns have fewer than 1,000 residents. Only one city in the state has a population of over 300,000: <a href='/us-cities/omaha-population/' target='_blank'>Omaha</a>. Its population is estimated at 452,061, which is nearly twice that of the stateâs capital, <a href='/us-cities/lincoln-population/' target='_blank'>Lincoln</a>.</p>
<p>The stateâs average population density is estimated to be around 25 people per square mile, which is far below the nationâs average of 87. Nebraskaâs counties continue to report declining numbers as the more urban areas experience growth. For example, Cortland, Nebraskaâs smallest city in terms of population, only has 466 residents.</p>
<h2 id="nevada">Nevada</h2>
<p>The landlocked state of Nevada covers 109,826 square miles of land area, making it the seventh-largest state in the country. This state is very sparsely filled; there are only eight states less densely populated than Nevada: Alaska, Wyoming, Montana, North and South Dakota, New Mexico, Idaho, and Nebraska.</p>
<p>Nevadaâs current population estimate is 3,087,025, indicating a growth of 14.23% from 2010âs census numbers. A small number of the population lives in rural areas, and the rural culture of Nevada is incredibly different from that of the metropolitan areas such as <a href='/us-cities/reno-population/' target='_blank'>Reno</a> and <a href='/us-cities/las-vegas-population/' target='_blank'>Las Vegas</a>. These metropolitan areas tend to be the most populated in Nevada.</p>
<p>Nevadaâs capital, <a href='/us-cities/carson-city-population/' target='_blank'>Carson City</a>, with a population of 54,521, is classified as an independent city and does not belong to any of the stateâs seventeen counties. The largest city in Nevada is Las Vegas, with a population of 664,304 people. Las Vegas is the 28th most populated city in the United States and is famous for its hotels, casinos, shopping centers, and fine dining.</p>
<h2 id="a-hrefstatesnew-hampshire-population-target_blanknew-hampshirea"><a href='/states/new-hampshire-population/' target='_blank'>New Hampshire</a></h2>
<p>New Hampshire is one of the six New England states in the northeastern United States. It is bordered by Massachusetts, Vermont, Maine, and the Canadian province, Quebec. It is also the seventh smallest state by landmass and the tenth least populated state. New Hampshire was one of the original 13 states, which has assisted in its historical tourism to a certain extent.</p>
<p>Though there only six states smaller than New Hampshire in size, its population density more than makes up for it with an average of 152 people per square mile. The estimated population of New Hampshire is 1.36 million, with a 3.58% growth rate from the 2010 estimate.</p>
<p>The largest city in the state is <a href='/world-cities/manchester-population/' target='_blank'>Manchester</a>, which is also the largest city in northern New England, with a population of 111,826. The smallest city in New Hampshire is Franklin, with 8,492, though many cities have approximately 10,000 residents in the area.</p>
<h2 id="a-hrefstatesnew-jersey-population-target_blanknew-jerseya"><a href='/states/new-jersey-population/' target='_blank'>New Jersey</a></h2>
<p>New <a href='/countries/jersey-population/' target='_blank'>Jersey</a> is one of the original thirteen colonies. The only states smaller than New Jersey are Connecticut, Delaware, Rhode Island, and Hawaii in terms of landmass. New Jersey is bordered to the south by the Atlantic Ocean and is situated on the northeastern edge of the United States. Its estimated population in 2019 is 8,922,547, up 1.4% from 8,799,624 in 2010.</p>
<p>New Jerseyâs territory is highly utilized, with an incredibly high population density of 1213 people per square mile, making it the most densely populated state in the United States. The only area more densely populated in the country is the District of Columbia, which is not technically a state. Every county in New Jersey is considered urban by the Census Bureau.</p>
<p>Despite the stateâs high population density, there are only four cities with a population above 100,000: <a href='/us-cities/newark-population/' target='_blank'>Newark</a>, <a href='/us-cities/jersey-city-population/' target='_blank'>Jersey City</a>, Paterson, and Elizabeth. Most of New Jerseyâs population lives in counties near <a href='/states/new-york-population/' target='_blank'>New York</a> City, <a href='/us-cities/philadelphia-population/' target='_blank'>Philadelphia</a>, and the Jersey Shore.</p>
<h2 id="new-mexico">New Mexico</h2>
<p>New Mexicoâs growth rate is 0.64% annually, ranking it 30th in the country. The 2010 nationwide census estimated New Mexicoâs population to be approximately 2,059,179, which was the first time the people had exceeded two million. The estimate represented an impressive 14.5% increase in the estimated population from a decade earlier.</p>
<p>New Mexico is the fifth-largest state by land area, covering 121,356 square miles. In 
2019, the population was estimated to be 2,096,034, which means the population is very sparsely distributed. New Mexicoâs average population density is only 17 people per square mile, far below the national average of 87 people per square mile. In fact, New Mexico is the sixth most sparsely populated territory in the country. Its mountain ranges, deserts, and abundant forests make for difficult residential terrain. Most of the stateâs residents are located in Bernalillo County. Despite being the second smallest county in the state in terms of area, Bernalillo houses more than a third of the stateâs population. The smallest town in New Mexico only has 31 people living there!</p>
<h2 id="new-a-hrefworld-citiesyork-population-target_blankyorka">New <a href='/world-cities/york-population/' target='_blank'>York</a></h2>
<p>Known as the Empire State, New York is among the most populated states in the country, with a population of 19,491,339. It is actually the most populated state on the East Coast and the fourth most populated state in the country. Out of a community of nearly 20 million, almost half of them reside in New York City, making it roughly equal to the entire population of New Jersey. New York City, the nationâs most populated city, is actually over 33 times larger than the second-largest city in New York, <a href='/us-cities/buffalo-population/' target='_blank'>Buffalo</a>. <a href='/us-cities/albany-population/' target='_blank'>Albany</a>, the state capital, has a population of 98,469 people, making it the sixth most populated city in the state.</p>
<p>Despite its massive population, New York has actually experienced a decrease in its growth rate since 2018: its population decreased by 0.26% from 19,542,209 in 2018 to 19,491,339 in 2019. Regardless of the decline in growth, New York still has a shocking average of 414 people per square mile, far above the national population density of 87! </p>
<h2 id="a-hrefstatesnorth-carolina-population-target_blanknorth-carolinaa"><a href='/states/north-carolina-population/' target='_blank'>North Carolina</a></h2>
<p>Situated on the east coast of the United States, North Carolina is the ninth most populated state, with an estimated 10,497,741 people. Its growth rate is approximately 1.13%, ranked 14th in the nation.</p>
<p>Though North Carolinaâs total landmass places it in the lower middle half of the rankings, its population density is impressive: there is an average of 196 people for every square mile, making North Carolina the 15th most densely populated state in the nation.</p>
<p><a href='/us-cities/charlotte-population/' target='_blank'>Charlotte</a> is the largest city in North Carolina with a population of 827,097 residents, making it almost exactly the same population size as South Dakota. North Carolina was one of the original 13 colonies and though the state has historically been considered rural, the past three decades have seen an increase in urbanization, and most areas now are considered urban and suburban.</p>
<h2 id="north-dakota">North Dakota</h2>
<p>North Dakota, also known as the Peace Garden State, the Roughrider State, and the 701, is the seventeenth-largest state in area, the fifth smallest by population, and the fourth most sparsely populated state. Though its economic development has led to population growth and reduced unemployment, its population is estimated only to be 760,900 people. North Dakota is currently experiencing one of the highest growth rates in the United States, second only to the District of Columbia, and estimates show that the stateâs population will break 800,000 by 2020.</p>
<p>North Dakotaâs only city with a population larger than 100,000 is <a href='/us-cities/fargo-population/' target='_blank'>Fargo</a>, where over 15% of the entire stateâs population resides. North Dakota does not designate its areas by population or government structure; it deems all areas as cities. As such, even the areas with populations below 100 inhabitants are considered cities in North Dakota.</p>
<h2 id="ohio">Ohio</h2>
<p>Despite being the 34th largest state, Ohio is the 7th most populated and 10th most densely populated in the country, with an estimated population of 11.72 million people as of 2019. It has one of the lowest growth rates in the country, increasing at a rate of only 0.67%, placing it at 43rd in the country.</p>
<p>While the populationâs growth rate is slow in Ohio, it still is higher than most of the country. Ohioâs population density of 287 people per square mile far exceeds the national average of 87, ranking it 10th in the nation, with a total land area of 44,825 square miles.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Ohioâs cities vary significantly in terms of growth and population. For example, <a href='/us-cities/columbus-population/' target='_blank'>Columbus</a> is growing at a rapid rate of nearly 10% every decade, while <a href='/us-cities/cleveland-population/' target='_blank'>Cleveland</a> is losing people at a rate of 23 people every day for almost five decades.</p>
<h2 id="oklahoma">Oklahoma</h2>
<p>The estimated population of Oklahoma in 2019 is approximately 3,948,950 residents. The state has a relatively low population density in keeping with its size and population rankings. Oklahoma is the 19th largest state in land area, covering 68,667 square miles, and for every square mile in the state, there is an average of 55 people. This figure makes Oklahoma the 35th most densely populated state in the country.</p>
<p>Oklahoma has nearly 600 incorporated areas, but only four cities have a population that exceeds 100,000 residents. 65% of Oklahoma residents live within the <a href='/us-cities/oklahoma-city-population/' target='_blank'>Oklahoma City</a> and <a href='/us-cities/tulsa-population/' target='_blank'>Tulsa</a> metro areas, with both being among the largest cities in the United States. Oklahoma City, the state capital, is the largest city in the state, with a population of 661,614, while Tulsa is the second-largest, with a population of 403,045. In these two cities, the population density exceeds 5,000 people per square mile, though the rest of the state remains mostly under 55 people per square mile.</p>
<h2 id="oregon">Oregon</h2>
<p>Oregon covers 95,997 square miles of land, making it the 9th largest in the United States, though its population is sparsely distributed over its territory. The natural geography of the state plays a significant role in this; the mountain ranges and vast forest areas make the area unsuitable for major settlement. Despite the large land surface area, the state has an estimated 2019 population of 4.25 million.</p>
<p>Parts of Oregon are ruled by geographical elements that make the area unsuitable for residential development and as a result, the average population density is a mere 44 people per square mile. This figure makes Oregon the 39th most densely populated state in the country.</p>
<p>A significant amount of the Oregonian population is located in the Willamette Valley. Portland, Oregonâs largest city, is home to 667,589 people and is the 26th most populated city in the United States. <a href='/us-cities/salem-population/' target='_blank'>Salem</a>, the stateâs capital, is also the next largest city, with a population of 177,019 residents.</p>
<h2 id="a-hrefstatespennsylvania-population-target_blankpennsylvaniaa"><a href='/states/pennsylvania-population/' target='_blank'>Pennsylvania</a></h2>
<p>The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania is a state located in the northeastern, Great Lakes, and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States. It is bordered by Delaware, Maryland, West Virginia, Ohio, New York, New Jersey, Lake Erie, and <a href='/us-cities/ontario-population/' target='_blank'>Ontario</a>.</p>
<p>Pennsylvaniaâs current growth rate is just 0.24%, ranking 42nd in the nation. The 2019 estimated population in the state is approximately 12.81 million residents, making it the sixth most populated state in the country.</p>
<p>Though Pennsylvania has a small land surface area, its population density is relatively high, as most of the Eastern states. It is currently the ninth most densely populated state in the country, with a density of 286 people per square mile. A majority of the stateâs population is located in and around Philadelphia, as the city has a population of 1.56 million residents. Thatâs a larger population than the entire state of Hawaii! </p>
<h2 id="puerto-rico">Puerto Rico</h2>
<p>Puerto Rico, Spanish for ârich portâ and officially the âCommonwealth of Puerto Rico,â is an unincorporated territory of the United States located in the northeast <a href='/continents/caribbean-population/' target='_blank'>Caribbean</a> Sea, approximately 1000 miles southeast of <a href='/us-cities/miami-population/' target='_blank'>Miami</a>, Florida.</p>
<p>If Puerto Rico were a full state in the United States, it would be the 29th largest state, ranked between Oklahoma and Connecticut. The last official census results from 2010 indicated that Puerto Ricoâs population was approximately 3.73 million residents. The latest census estimates point to a decrease in the overall population size from the 2010 census, as well as the population size from 2018 to 2019. The reduction from 2018 to 2019 is a significant decline, measured at 2.55%.</p>
<p>The largest city in Puerto Rico is the islandâs capital, <a href='/world-cities/san-juan-population/' target='_blank'>San Juan</a>. Its population is estimated to be approximately 395,326, making it the 46th largest city in the United States. Puerto Rico is one of the most densely populated areas in the country, with an average of 900 people per square mile.</p>
<h2 id="rhode-island">Rhode Island</h2>
<p>Rhode Island is the smallest state in the country in terms of surface area, but its population and population density are no laughing matter. The estimated population in 2019 was 1.06 million, making it larger than seven other states in the country. The last official census results from 2010 indicated a population of 1.05, which means the community in Rhode Island has been increasing since, although the population did show a decrease of 0.05% from 2018 to 2019.</p>
<p>The state covers just 1,545 square miles, which means the population density is an impressive 1,022 people per square mile. Rhode Island follows New Jersey in terms of population density.</p>
<p>This tiny state only has five counties: <a href='/us-cities/providence-population/' target='_blank'>Providence</a>, Kent, Washington, <a href='/world-cities/newport-population/' target='_blank'>Newport</a>, and <a href='/world-cities/bristol-population/' target='_blank'>Bristol</a> County.

<h2 id="a-hrefstatessouth-carolina-population-target_blanksouth-carolinaa"><a href='/states/south-carolina-population/' target='_blank'>South Carolina</a></h2>
<p>South Carolina, located on the southeastern tip of the United States, is one of the smallest states in the country. Despite its size, it does have a high population density and is projected to continue its growth. South Carolinaâs population was estimated to be approximately 5.15 million in 2019, up from 5.08 million in 2018, ranking it 18th in terms of growth in the nation and the 24th most populated state in the country.</p>
<p>Like most states on the East coast, South Carolina is densely populated in comparison to its size. Though it only covers 30,110 square miles, making it the 40th largest state in the country, there is an average of 171 people per square mile.</p>
<p>The largest city in South Carolina is <a href='/us-cities/charleston-population/' target='_blank'>Charleston</a>, with a population of 140,178, followed closely by the capital, Columbia, with a population of 135,299. The smallest town in the state is Salley, with only 430 inhabitants.</p>

<p>The size of the state places it as the 16th largest in terms of land area, though the population is relatively sparse in comparison. Despite covering 75,885 square miles, there is only an average of 12 people per square mile. Like North Dakota, the geographical elements do not allow for mass urban settlement. That in addition to a lack of employment opportunities has contributed to the exodus to other areas in the country. </p>

Election Results"},{"article":"The 2016 presidential election in the United States resulted in Donald Trump being elected as the 45th President of the United States. \n\nThe United States uses the Electoral College, a process where the people vote to choose their electors, then a meeting of 538 electors takes place to vote for the presidential candidates, and then Congress counts the electoral votes. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President.\n\nA stateâs number of electors is identical to the total number of its senators and representatives in Congress. Seven states and Washington D.C. have the minimum of three electors. California has the most electoral votes, with 55, followed by Texas with 38 and New York and Florida is 29 each. \n\nWhen citizens head to the polls on Election Day, they vote for which candidate they want to win, typically either Democratic or Republican, and then whichever party wins the vote in that state will have its electors sent to cast their votes for that candidate. In all states, except Maine and Nebraska, the party that wins the popular vote gets to send all of its electors to vote.

The most Democratic state in the 2016 election was Washington D.C., which voted over 90% Democratic, followed by Hawaii, which voted 62.22% Democratic.\n\nPresident Donald Trump won the 2016 election

Cornersâ is used to describe a point where the boundaries of four states meet. There is only one such point in the entire nation. The four states that are part of this region are Colorado, Utah, Arizona, and New Mexico. The area is made up of the southwestern corner of Utah, the northwestern corner of New Mexico, the southeastern corner of Utah, and the northeastern corner of New Mexico.\n\nThe United States initially acquired this region following the Mexican-American War in 1848 when Congress began defining the boundaries in the 1860s differently. Instead of using the lines of latitude and longitude, Congress instead created the Arizona Territory as a line running south from the southwest corner of Colorado Territory. This new way of defining boundaries ensured that four states would eventually meet at this point.\n\nThe Four Corners are marked by the Four Corners Monument, which is a popular tourist attraction. However, that isnât all that the region has to offer. Many other areas in the region are visited by tourists, including Mesa Verde National Park and the Canyon de Chelly National Monument.\n\nMost of the land that makes up the Four Corners area is owned by semi-autonomous Native Americans, including the Navajo Nation, the Ute, Zuni, and Hopi tribes.\n\nMost of the region is rural. The only metropolitan area, which is also the economic hub of the region, is Farmington, a city in New Mexico. This is the most populous city with a population of just over 45,000 people.\n\nThe United States has many interesting landmarks. From the Grand Canyon to Mount Rushmore to Niagara Falls, you can see it all in the United States. One of the unique landmarks in the United States is the Four Corners Monument, which marks an area of the nation where four states meet.\n\nWhat makes the Four Corners region so unique is that it is the only point in the U.S. where four states meet. This region in the Southwestern United States was originally Indian land before being claimed by Spain. After Mexico became independent from Spain, it became the owner of this land. However, Mexico ceded the property over to the United States in the mid-1800s during the Mexican-American War. In the years that followed, territories were broken up into states, and the 4 Corners region became the first of its kind in the nation.\n\nA monument was erected to mark the quadripoint in the early 20th century, and it has been rebuilt throughout the years. Most recently, it was rebuilt in 2010.\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Four Corners States"},"data":{"states":["Arizona","Colorado","New Mexico","Utah"],"customMeta":{"relatedArticles":["bible-belt-states","border-states","coastal-states",{"link":"4-corners-states","title":"Four Corners States"},"east-coast-states","eastern-states","flyover-states","gulf-states","great-lakes-states","lower-48-states",{"link":"midwest-states","title":"Midwestern United States"},{"link":"mid-atlantic-states","title":"Mid-Atlantic States"},"mountain-states","new-england-states","northern-states","rust-belt-states","southeast-states","southwest-states","west-coast-states"]}},"sources":[{"name":"Four Corners - Where 4 States Meet Near Grand Canyon","link":"https://www.mygrandcanyonpark.com/things-to-do/four-corners-and-beyond"}],"lastModified":"2020-04-06T20:09:05.144Z","path":"4-corners-states","name":"4 Corners States"},{"article":"Paying for college can be a struggle for anyone. With tuition costs of the rise, as well as other associated expenses including books, lab fees, and room and board, students and families across the nation are looking at ways to reduce this financial burden without having to turn to student loans. \n\nWhile grants and scholarships are always a great option, many families start saving for their childrenâs education through a 529 plan. Each state has its own plan which offers advantages to families who save for their childrenâs education.

Grandparents, aunts, uncles, and others can contribute to a 529 plan to help cover educational expenses.

Abortion is a controversial subject in many countries due to moral, ethical, religious and political reasons. \n\nThe 1973 Supreme Court case Roe v. Wade was a landmark decision for abortion in the United States. The case involved a woman living in Texas, using the name âJane Roeâ who became pregnant with her third child but wanted an abortion. Abortion was illegal in Texas except when the pregnancy is deadly for the bother. She hired two attorneys who filed on her behalf against district attorney Henry Wade, alleging that the abortion law was unconstitutional. The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas ruled in her favor, which was appealed by Texas to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nThe Supreme Court ruled that a woman had the right to choose whether or not to have an abortion, and the three trimesters of pregnancy were used as a framework for its legality. In the first trimester, governments could not prohibit a woman from choosing to have an abortion as long as it was done by a licensed physician. In the second trimester, governments could enact medical regulations regarding abortions as long as they were tailored to protect the motherâs health. In the third trimester, governments could legally prohibit all abortions unless the procedure was necessary to protect the motherâs life or health.\n\nThis decision had caused a clear divide in the US, with âpro-choiceâ and âpro-lifeâ teams. Because of a newly conservative US Supreme Court, many states are working to pass newly restriction abortion laws to get them in front of the Supreme Court to challenge the decision of Roe v. Wade.\n\nBelow is a list of each stateâs abortion laws, including newly passed legislation that has no gone into effect yet.\n\n## Alabama\nOn May 14, 2019, Alabama signed a law banning abortion at any stage of pregnancy, including if the pregnancy is a result of rape or incest. An exception would be made if the motherâs health is in danger or a fetal abnormality that would be fatal to the baby after birth. \n\n## Alaska\nAbortion in Alaska is legal. A licensed physician must perform the procedure. Patients under 17 must have parental consent. House Bill 178 was proposed in 2019 to ban legal abortion in Alaska, with no exceptions made for the motherâs life or in cases of rape or incest.\n\n## Arkansas\nOn May 15, 2019, Arkansas signed a law banning abortion after 18 weeks, with exceptions made for rape, incest, and medical emergencies. The law previously banned abortion after 20 weeks. \n\n## Arizona\nArizona abortion laws permit legal abortions up to 24 weeks of pregnancy. Patients are required to meet a physician at least 24 hours before the procedure to get state-administered information, and a licensed physician must perform the procedure. Patients who are minors must have notarized consent by a parent or guardian. \n\n## California\nCalifornia abortion laws are less restrictive than most of the other states. Abortion in California is legal. Nurse-midwives and other non-physician medical professions are permitted to perform the procedure as long as they have proper training. Public state universities are required to provide students with the abortion pill, Mifepristone, at no cost.\n\n## Colorado\nAbortion in Colorado is legal. There are no laws restricting access to the procedure, and no laws protecting a womanâs right to it. Both parents (with exceptions), or the legal guardian(s) of a woman under 18 must be given notice before an abortion. \n\n## Connecticut\nConnecticut abortion laws state that abortion prior to the viability of the fetus is legal and a decision made solely by the pregnant woman. Abortions can only be done by a licensed physician.\n\n## Delaware\nDelaware abortion laws state that abortion prior to the viability of the fetus is legal. The procedure must be done by a licensed physician. Women under the age of 18 or who are mentally ill or incompetent must have parental consent. Two proposed bills have not made it to a floor vote: one that bans abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy, and one that gives a woman the chance to receive an ultrasound of the fetus before the procedure.\n\n## District of Columbia\nWashington D.C.âs abortion laws are the least restrictive in the United States. Abortions are legal in the District of Columbia and do not need to be performed by a licensed physician. There is no ban on late-term abortions.\n\n## Florida \nFlorida abortion laws state abortion is legal prior to 24 weeks of pregnancy. A woman must receive an ultrasound before the procedure and a licensed physician must perform the procedure. A parent or legal guardian must be notified if the patient is a minor.\n\n## Georgia\nGeorgia abortion laws are restrictive. On May 7, 2019, Georgia signed a âfetal heartbeatâ law, which bans abortions after six weeks of pregnancy. Exceptions are made for mothers whose lives are at risk due to the pregnancy, and in cases of rape or incest if a police report is filed. The procedure must be done by a licensed physician and the physician has a right to refuse to participate.\n\n## Hawaii\nHawaii abortion laws state that abortion is legal prior to the viability of the fetus. A licensed physician must perform the procedure. \n\n## Idaho\nIdaho abortion laws state that abortion is legal prior to the viability of the fetus. Women must receive mandatory counseling and wait 24 hours after their initial appointment to have the procedure done. Patients under 18 must have the consent of one parent or guardian. Third-trimester abortions are allowed only if the motherâs life is in danger.\n\n## Illinois \nIllinoisâs Reproductive Health Act enacted on June 12, 2019, states that women have a fundamental right to abortion and insurers are required to cover abortions and other reproductive health services. An abortion can be done after viability if the womanâs life is in danger. A licensed physician must perform the procedure. Patients who are minors must have parental consent.\n\n## Indiana\nIndiana abortion laws state that abortion is legal if performed by a doctor during the first trimester of pregnancy, or in a hospital or surgical center before a fetus is viable. After viability, abortion is only allowed to protect the health of the mother and must be done in a premature birth unit with a second physician present. Minors must get parental consent. \n\n\n## Iowa\nIowa abortion laws state that abortion is legal within the first 20 weeks of pregnancy. The procedure must be done by a licensed physician. Patients under the age of 18 must have a parent or guardian notified of the abortion 48 hours before the procedure.\n\n## Kansas\nKansasâs abortion laws state that abortion is legal within the first 20 weeks of pregnancy. The procedure must be done by a licensed physician.

Abortions can be performed surgically or by medication. \r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court decision of Roe v. Wade states that governments cannot regulate a womanâs decision to have an abortion before the viability of the fetus. After viability, no government can impose a regulation that favors a fetusâs life over the motherâs. Even with this decision, abortion has caused nationwide controversy and has divided people into pro-life or pro-choice camps.\r\n\r\nRecently, some states have been proposing legislation to further restrict abortions earlier than fetus viability. States have recently introduced the âheartbeatâ bill, which prohibits abortions have six weeks of pregnancy or when a fetal heartbeat can be detected. \r\n\r\nWith such controversy over the procedure, one might not realize how frequently abortions happen. According to 2014 data from the Guttmacher Institute, there were a total of 926,240 abortions in the United States.\r\n\r\nAbortion rate is calculated as the number of abortions per 1,000 women ages 15-44 years old. The ten states with the highest abortion rates were:\r\n\r\n1.\tDistrict of Columbia (32.7)\r\n2.\tNew York (29.6)\r\n3.\tNew Jersey (25.8)\r\n4.\tMaryland (23.4)\r\n5.\tFlorida (20.6)\r\n6.\tCalifornia (19.5)\r\n7.\tNevada (19.4)\r\n8.\tConnecticut (19.2)\r\n9.\tRhode Island (17)\r\n10.\tDelaware (16.7)\r\n\r\n#### States with the Highest Abortion Rates\r\n\r\nThe District of Columbia has the highest abortion rate in America of 32.7. The District of Columbia had a total of 5,820 abortions in 2014, about 38% of total pregnancies. In the 1971 Supreme Court case [United States v. Vuitch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Vuitch), a federal district judge made the first federal court decision declaring an abortion law unconstitutional and allowing abortion for âhealthâ reasons including âpsychological and physical well-being.â As a result, D.C. became a destination for women seeking abortion that year. As of 2017, there is only one Planned Parenthood clinic in Washington D.C. offering abortion services. \r\n\r\nNew York has the second-highest abortion rate of 29.6. New York had a total of 119,940 abortions, about 33% of total pregnancies. In 2019, New York passed the Reproductive Health Act (RHA), repealing a pre-Roe v. Wade provision that banned third-trimester abortions except in cases where the pregnancy endangers the woman. The bill also allowed qualified health practitioners to perform abortions, not just licensed medical doctors. As of May 14, 2019, the state prohibited abortions after the fetus is viable, generally at some point between 24 and 28 weeks.\r\n\r\nNew Jersey has the third-highest abortion rate in America of 25.8.

The state also does not require waiting periods or prohibit state funding for abortions. \r\n\r\nMaryland has the fourth-highest abortion rate of 23.4. Maryland had a total of 28,140 abortions, about 28% of total pregnancies. In Maryland, five Planned Parenthood clinics offer abortion services. In response to the abortion bans in Alabama and Georgia, former Maryland House Speaker Michael Busch proposed an amendment to Marylandâs constitution to preserve the right for women to have an abortion. As of May 14, 2019, the state prohibited abortions after the fetus is viable, generally at some point between 24 and 28 weeks.\r\n\r\nFlorida has the fifth-highest abortion rate in America of 20.6. Florida had a total of 75,990 abortions, about 26% of total pregnancies. In 2019, two attempts were made to implement a fetal heartbeat bill, House Bill 235 and Senate Bill 792, both of which were defeated in the Health Quality Committee and Health Policy, respectively. As of May 14, 2019, the state prohibited abortions after the fetus is viable, generally at some point between 24 and 28 weeks.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### States with the Lowest Abortion Rates\r\n\r\nWyoming has the lowest abortion rate of 1.1.

On March 22, 2019, the fetal heartbeat bill was signed into law by Mississippi Governor Phil Bryant, which was blocked by Judge Carlton Reeves on May 24, 2019. \r\n\r\nKentucky has the fourth-lowest abortion rate in America of 4.1. Kentucky had 3,530 abortions in 2014, about 6% of total pregnancies. On March 15, 2019, Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin signed the fetal heartbeat bill, which was temporarily blocked in court by a federal judge on the same day. Before the heartbeat bill, abortions in Kentucky were banned after 20 weeks of pregnancy.\r\n\r\nIdaho has the fifth-lowest abortion rate of 4.2. There were 1,320 abortions in Idaho, about 5% of total pregnancies. As of 2017, there are three abortion clinics in Idaho.

In some jurisdictions, this is true even if both partners are themselves younger than the age of consent and both parties could technically be prosecuted.\n\n## Penalties\nOne or more of charges may be used to prosecute violations of a stateâs age of consent laws, such as statutory rape or the stateâs equivalent of that charge. \n\nThe severity of the criminal charge (e.g. Class A felony, Class B felony, misdemeanor, etc) depends on the specific acts committed and the relative ages of the perpetrator and victim.  Those found guilty face fines and jail time, as much as $25,000 and fifty years in prison, depending on the state.\n\n## Age of Consent Range in the United States\nThe states laws do differ and the minimum age of consent in the United States is sixteen and the maximum is eighteen years old.  To summarize the number of states by their age of consent (as of July 2019):\n\nFrom time to time, states do update their laws, including the age of consent.  For example, from 2018 to 2019, Wyoming and New Mexico raised their age of consent from sixteen to seventeen.\n\n## Consenting Age Difference\nIn some states, there is a close-in-age exemption.  This is stipulated by some states to allow an exception when consensual sex involves an individual, or individuals, who are underage and the partners are close in age.  \n\nThis age-dependent exemption is also known as the \"Romeo and Juliet law\" and is designed to prevent the prosecution of underage couples who engage in consensual sex when:\n\n- Both participants are close-in-age, and\n- One or both are below the age of consent.  \n\nAs of July 2019, there are twenty-five states, as well as the District of Columbia, that have a close-in-age of exemption, and twenty-five states that do not.  The allowed age difference is typically in the two to five-year range, but Utahâs close-in-age exemptions allow teens aged sixteen to seventeen years old to consent to partners less than seven years older, and partners between seven to ten years older if the partner had no reasonable knowledge of the minor's age.\n\nThen there are other exemptions and specifics depending on the particular state.  These can greatly vary and can become quite complicated.  For example, in North Carolina, it is a crime regardless of age to sexually engage with a student if the defendant is a:\n\n- school teacher,\n- student teacher,\n- school administrator,\n- school safety officer,\n- coach, or\n- other school employees at the child's school.\n\nBut there is an exception to all of this if the two partners are married, then the age of consent does not apply.  \n\nAs you can see from the North Carolina example, the age of consent laws become complicated depending on what stateâs laws are in effect.  For this reason, short reviews for eight other states are included below.\n\n## California\nAge of Consent: 18    Close-in-age Exemption: No\n\nAt just under forty million people, California is the most populous state.  Its age of consent is eighteen, and anyone seventeen or under is considered incapable of consenting to sex in California.  So, anyone having sex with a partner under eighteen is theoretically committing a crime.  Even if both partners are under eighteen, technically, both can be prosecuted under the stateâs law.  \n\nCaliforniaâs statutory rape law is violated when a person has consensual sexual intercourse with an individual under age eighteen who is not their spouse.  Punishments vary depending on the respective ages of both victim and offender.  Separate crimes exist for sodomy with minors and sexual intercourse with a child under age fourteen when the attacker is at least seven years older.\n\nCalifornia has seven statutory sexual abuse charges on the books.\n\n## Texas\nAge of Consent: 17    Close-in-age Exemption: No\n\nAnother populous state, the Texas statutory rape law is violated when a person has consensual sexual intercourse with an individual under seventeen.  While there is no close-in-age exemption, potential defenses exist when the offender is no more than three years older than the victim and of the opposite sex.  Sexual intercourse between an employee of a school and a student is prohibited unless they are married, and no age of consent is specified in the special instance of a school employee and student that engaged in sexual intercourse. \n\nTexas has five statutory sexual abuse charges on the books.\n\n## Florida\nAge of Consent: 18    Close-in-age Exemption: Yes\n\nAs one of the retirement destinations in the U.S., the state is the third most populous and the age of consent is eighteen.  So, anyone seventeen or under is considered incapable of consenting to sex.  Florida does have a close-in-age exemption, or Romeo and Juliet law, but is a bit different.  It allows minors aged sixteen or seventeen to engage in consensual sexual intercourse with a partner no older than the age of twenty-three.\n\nFlorida has four statutory sexual abuse charges on the books. \n\n## Alabama\nAge of Consent: 16    Close-in-age Exemption: Yes\n\nWhile the age of consent is stated as sixteen, Alabamaâs statutory rape law is violated when an individual over the age of eighteen engages in sexual intercourse with a person over the age of twelve and under age sixteen.  Or, when a person sixteen or older engages in sexual intercourse with a victim that is at least two years younger.  \n\nAdditionally, an offender commits the crime of sodomy if an individual age sixteen or older engages in deviate sexual intercourse with a person under sixteen and older than twelve, and this is enforced as a statutory charge.\n\nAlabama has ten statutory sexual abuse charges on the books. \n\n## Georgia\nAge of Consent: 16    Close-in-age Exemption: No\n\nWhen a person has consensual sexual intercourse with an individual under the age of sixteen who is not their spouse, the Georgia statutory rape law is violated.  While no close-in-age exemption exists in Georgia, if the offender is under age nineteen and the victim is no more than four years younger, the offense is classified as a misdemeanor rather than a felony.\n\nGeorgia has eight statutory sexual abuse charges on the books. \n\n## New York\nAge of Consent: 17    Close-in-age Exemption: No\n\nA large and populous state, the New York statutory rape law is violated when a person has consensual sexual intercourse with an individual under the age of seventeen, who they are not married to. Punishment varies depending on the age of the offender. Also, in New York, there is no defense based on a lack of knowledge of the victim's age.\n\nNew York has fifteen statutory sexual abuse charges on the books. \n\n## Pennsylvania\nAge of Consent: 16 or 18    Close-in-age Exemption: Yes\n\nIf both parties are under eighteen, Pennsylvania has an age of consent of sixteen years old.  Or, if the defendant is eighteen or older, the age of consent is eighteen.  \n\nThe stateâs statutory rape law defines the age of consent as sixteen and it conflicts with another law; Pennsylvania's corruption of minors statute indicates that the age of consent is eighteen.  This has produced some confusion since the laws in this state now allow teens aged sixteen and seventeen to consent to each other, but not to anyone eighteen or older. Teens between thirteen and fifteen may or may not be able to consent to a partner less than four years older.  It is uncertain because while a defendant might not be affected by the statutory rape laws, they could be prosecuted under other offenses.\n\nPennsylvania has six statutory sexual abuse charges on the books. \n\n## Ohio\nAge of Consent: 16    Close-in-age Exemption: Yes\n\nOhio statutory rape law is violated when a person has consensual sexual intercourse with an individual whom they are not married to that is under the age of sixteen.  A close-in-age exemption exists allowing minors aged thirteen and older to consent to a partner under the age of eighteen.\n\nOhio has five statutory sexual abuse charges on the books. \n\n","data":{"states":[],"customMeta":{"columns":["state",{"header":"Age of Consent","field":"ageOfConsent"},{"header":"Acceptable Age Difference","field":"acceptableAgeDiff"}],"sortField":"ageOfConsent","sortAsc":true,"showAllStates":true,"relatedArticles":["common-law-marriage-states","gay-marriage-by-state","marriage-age-by-state","same-sex-marriage-states","incest-laws-by-state","age-of-consent-by-state","best-states-to-raise-a-family","teen-pregnancy-rates-by-state"]},"customData":[{"state":"Alabama","ageOfConsent":16,"acceptableAgeDiff":2},{"state":"Alaska","ageOfConsent":16,"acceptableAgeDiff":3},{"state":"Arizona","ageOfConsent":18,"acceptableAgeDiff":2},{"state":"Arkansas","ageOfConsent":16,"acceptableAgeDiff":3},{"state":"California","ageOfConsent":18,"acceptableAgeDiff":0},{"state":"Colorado","ageOfConsent":17,"acceptableAgeDiff":4},{"state":"Connecticut","ageOfConsent":16,"acceptableAgeDiff":2},{"state":"Delaware","ageOfConsent":18,"acceptableAgeDiff":0},{"state":"Florida","ageOfConsent":18,"acceptableAgeDiff":0},{"state":"Georgia","ageOfConsent":16,"acceptableAgeDiff":0},{"state":"Hawaii","ageOfConsent":16,"acceptableAgeDiff":5},{"state":"Idaho","ageOfConsent":18,"acceptableAgeDiff":0},{"state":"Illinois","ageOfConsent":17,"acceptableAgeDiff":0},{"state":"Indiana","ageOfConsent":16,"acceptableAgeDiff":0},{"state":"Iowa","ageOfConsent":16,"acceptableAgeDiff":4},{"state":"Kansas","ageOfConsent":16,"acceptableAgeDiff":0},{"state":"Kentucky","ageOfConsent":16,"acceptableAgeDiff":0},{"state":"Louisiana","ageOfConsent":17,"acceptableAgeDiff":3},{"state":"Maine","ageOfConsent":16,"acceptableAgeDiff":5},{"state":"Maryland","ageOfConsent":16,"acceptableAgeDiff":4},{"state":"Massachusetts","ageOfConsent":16,"acceptableAgeDiff":0},{"state":"Michigan","ageOfConsent":16,"acceptableAgeDiff":0},{"state":"Minnesota","ageOfConsent":16,"acceptableAgeDiff":2},{"state":"Mississippi","ageOfConsent":16,"acceptableAgeDiff":2},{"state":"Missouri","ageOfConsent":17,"acceptableAgeDiff":0},{"state":"Montana","ageOfConsent":16,"acceptableAgeDiff":0},{"state":"Nebraska","ageOfConsent":16,"acceptableAgeDiff":0},{"state":"Nevada","ageOfConsent":16,"acceptableAgeDiff":0},{"state":"New Hampshire","ageOfConsent":16,"acceptableAgeDiff":0},{"state":"New Jersey","ageOfConsent":16,"acceptableAgeDiff":4},{"state":"New Mexico","ageOfConsent":16,"acceptableAgeDiff":4},{"state":"New York","ageOfConsent":17,"acceptableAgeDiff":0},{"state":"North Carolina","ageOfConsent":16,"acceptableAgeDiff":4},{"state":"North Dakota","ageOfConsent":18,"acceptableAgeDiff":0},{"state":"Ohio","ageOfConsent":16,"acceptableAgeDiff":0},{"state":"Oklahoma","ageOfConsent":16,"acceptableAgeDiff":0},{"state":"Oregon","ageOfConsent":18,"acceptableAgeDiff":3},{"state":"Pennsylvania","ageOfConsent":16,"acceptableAgeDiff":4},{"state":"Rhode Island","ageOfConsent":16,"acceptableAgeDiff":0},{"state":"South Carolina","ageOfConsent":16,"acceptableAgeDiff":0},{"state":"South Dakota","ageOfConsent":16,"acceptableAgeDiff":3},{"state":"Tennessee","ageOfConsent":18,"acceptableAgeDiff":4},{"state":"Texas","ageOfConsent":17,"acceptableAgeDiff":3},{"state":"Utah","ageOfConsent":18,"acceptableAgeDiff":10},{"state":"Vermont","ageOfConsent":16,"acceptableAgeDiff":0},{"state":"Virginia","ageOfConsent":18,"acceptableAgeDiff":0},{"state":"Washington","ageOfConsent":16,"acceptableAgeDiff":2},{"state":"West Virginia","ageOfConsent":16,"acceptableAgeDiff":4},{"state":"Wisconsin","ageOfConsent":18,"acceptableAgeDiff":0},{"state":"Wyoming","ageOfConsent":16,"acceptableAgeDiff":4}]},"sources":[{"name":"Statutory Rape: The Age of Consent","link":"https://www.legalmatch.com/law-library/article/statutory-rape-the-age-of-consent.html"}],"lastModified":"2020-04-06T20:09:05.144Z","path":"age-of-consent-by-state","name":"Age Of Consent By State"},{"article":"The age of majority is defined as the age that a person is considered a legal adult. A person that has reached the age of majority is legally held responsible for their own actions, such as signing a contract or committing a crime.

The age of majority also differs from other legal ages, including voting age, driving age, and marriage age. \n\nIn most states in the United States, the age of majority is 18 years old. However, this is not the case for every state. A total of 47 states plus Washington, D.C., have laws that set the age of majority at 18 years old.

Pollution in the United States is a serious issue that not only hurts the planet but is also harmful to humans.\r\n\r\nAir pollution can cause a variety of health problems such as accelerated aging of the lungs and decreased function of the lungs, development of asthma, bronchitis, and possible cancer, and cardiovascular and respiratory illness. Additionally, people can experience reduced resistance to infections, increased fatigue, and uncomfortable symptoms such as chest pain, dry throat, wheezing, headaches, or nausea. \r\n\r\nThe [Clean Air Act (CAA)](https://www.epa.gov/clean-air-act-overview) is the federal law that regulates air emissions and authorizes the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to establish National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) to regulate hazardous air pollutants and to protect public health and welfare. The Air Quality Index is a key tool in the CAA that allows the EPA to provide important information to the public about air quality.\r\n\r\n## Air Quality Index\r\n\r\nThe Air Quality Index (AQI) is an index calculated for four major air pollutants regulated by the Clean Air Act: ground-level ozone, particle pollution, carbon monoxide, and sulfur dioxide. The AQI runs from zero to 500, with zero representing clean air and 500 being the most hazardous. Values of 100 or below are generally thought of as satisfactory; however, when values are above 100, air quality is considered to be unhealthy for certain at-risk groups of people and becomes more unsafe as the value increases.\r\n\r\nThe Air Quality Index has six categories that respond to different levels of health concerns.  These are:\r\n\r\n1.\tAQI is 0-50. Air quality conditions are good and this is symbolized by the color green. Air quality poses little or no health risk. \r\n2.\tAQI is 51-100. Air quality conditions are moderate and this is symbolized by the color yellow. Those who are sensitive may experience some respiratory symptoms at this level. \r\n3.\tAQI is 101-150. Air quality conditions are unhealthy for sensitive groups and this is symbolized by the color orange. Sensitive groups include older adults, children, and those with lung conditions or diseases. \r\n4.\tAQI is 151-200. Air quality conditions are unhealthy and this is symbolized by the color red. At this level, everyone may begin to feel the effects of the air quality and sensitive groups will feel more intense effects. \r\n5.\tAQI is 210-300. Air quality conditions are very unhealthy and this is symbolized by the color purple.\r\n6.\tAQI is 301-500. Air quality conditions are hazardous and this is symbolized by the color maroon. \r\n\r\n## States with the Best Air Quality\r\n\r\n#### Hawaii\r\nHawaii has an air quality index of 21.2, the cleanest average air in the U.S. This is well in the good air quality index range. According to the American Lung Associationâs âState of the Air â 2019 report, Honolulu and Kahului-Wailuku-Lahaina are two of the cleanest areas in the U.S. Honolulu is one of six cities in the U.S. that ranked on all three of the [American Lung Associationâs cleanest cities lists](https://www.lung.org/our-initiatives/healthy-air/sota/key-findings/cleanest-cities.html) for ozone, year-round particle pollution, and short-term particle pollution. The largest threats to Hawaiiâs air quality are volcanic activity and climate change.\r\n\r\n#### Alaska\r\nAlaskaâs air quality index is 29.1, the second-best index in the U.S. While the state itself has good air quality, Alaskans living in Anchorage or Mat-Su Borough will experience particle pollution problems due to wood-burning home heating. Both of these areas, however, have seen improvements in air quality in recent years. Most areas can be found in the âgoodâ AQI range most of the year.\r\n\r\n#### Washington\r\nWashingtonâs air quality index is 33.5, placing it in third for the best air quality. Washington has both some of the cleanest and some of the most polluted air. Most areas in Washington remain in the âgoodâ AQI range and sometimes reach into the âmoderateâ range. According to the [Department of Ecology]( https://ecology.wa.gov/About-us/Get-to-know-us/Our-Programs/Air-Quality), 100% of the stateâs population lives in communities that meet the state and federal air quality standard. Washingtonâs main sources of pollution are motor vehicles, wood smoke, and wildfire burning. \r\n\r\n#### Oregon\r\nThe state with the fourth-best quality of air is Oregon. Oregonâs air quality index is 36.1. Currently, all Oregon residents live in areas that meet federal air quality standards. Two ballot measures are being pushed in Oregon for 2020: 100% Clean Economy and 100% Clean Electricity. These measures will push for Oregon to be a 100% clean economy by 2050 and for Oregonâs electricity to come from 100% clean, renewable, and affordable sources by 2050. \r\n\r\n#### Maine\r\nMaineâs air quality index is 36.5. Maine saw a large improvement in air quality from 2018 to 2019, however, some residents are living in areas where the air is unhealthy due to emissions from power plants. Bangor is one of six cities in the U.S. that ranked on all three of the [American Lung Associationâs cleanest cities lists](https://www.lung.org/our-initiatives/healthy-air/sota/key-findings/cleanest-cities.html) for ozone, year-round particle pollution, and short-term particle pollution. \r\n\r\n## States with the Worst Air Quality\r\n\r\n#### Utah\r\nUtahâs air quality index is 51.2, which puts it in the âmoderateâ AQI range and makes Utah the state with the worst air quality on average. One of the reasons for Utahâs poor air quality is its mountainous topography, which can cause pollution to build up near the surface. Utah has been actively taking steps to help improve air quality such as increasing solar energy use and enacting 30 new rules that reduce emissions from sources. \r\n\r\n#### Ohio\r\nOhioâs air quality index is 48.2, just barely keeping its average air quality within the âgoodâ range and giving Ohio the overall second-worst air quality in the U.S. According to the American Lung Associationâs 2019 âState of the Airâ report found that Cleveland was the ninth-most polluted city in the U.S. for year-round particle pollution and Cincinnati was found to be the thirteenth-worst state. Fortunately, the report also found that year-round particle pollution levels in cities such as Columbus, Akron, and Cleveland were at their lowest ever. \r\n\r\n#### Georgia\r\nGeorgiaâs air quality index of 48.2 ties it with Ohio as having the second-worst air quality in the United States. Atlanta is the largest metro area in Georgia that continues to struggle with air quality. Atlanta, known for its long periods of high traffic, gets most of its nitrogen oxides (the chemical that causes pollution) from tailpipe emissions from cars and trucks. Atlanta ranks second for the most air pollution from vehicles, according to the Georgia Department of Natural Resources. Additionally, the American Lung Association of Georgia found that approximately 11% of children in Georgia have asthma, almost double the national average. \r\n\r\n#### West Virginia\r\nWest Virginiaâs air quality is the fourth-worst overall in the U.S. with an index of 47.6. Power plants in West Virginia might be [a large source of pollution for other states](https://grist.org/justice/your-states-air-pollution-might-be-coming-from-another-states-power-plants/) in addition to their own state. West Virginiaâs two other main sources of pollution are car emissions and the coal industry, which has not only polluted their air but has severely damaged the stateâs water. While air quality is improving across West Virginia, especially with fine particle air pollution, smog levels have increased across the state.\r\n\r\n#### Indiana\r\nJust below West Virginia with an air quality index of 47.5 is Indiana. Indianaâs main sources of pollution include the dependence of automobiles and the lack of investment in public transportation. Additionally, Indianaâs coal-fired power plants, located in the southwest part of the state, generate air pollution that is carried by winds to the eastern parts of the state and beyond to other states (similar to the power plants in West Virginia). Indiana ranks poorly for drinking water quality, industrial toxins, pollution health risks, and urban air quality, according to a [ranking published by U.S. News and World Report](https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/rankings/natural-environment). \r\n\r\n\r\n[AQI's in the table](http://www.usa.com/rank/us--air-quality-index--state-rank.htm) below are averages.

Consumption By State"},{"article":"Ever since the passage of the 21st Amendment, which repealed the 18th Amendment, alcoholic beverages have been available for sale and consumption. However, there are specific rules and regulations that each state has that helps them abide by the law. They expect each of their citizens to follow these laws accordingly, and there could be significant consequences if they are not supported. Now, here are the alcohol laws applied and enforced around the country. \n\n## Consumption\nTypically, a person has to be at least 21-years-old to drink alcohol, especially in public places. This rule was established after the passing of the Federal Uniform Drinking Age Act of 1984, and the majority of states throughout the United States enforce this rule. \n\nThere are some states, on the other hand, that make exceptions to this rule for specific reasons, some including:\n\n- For religious practices (26 states)\n- For education (11 states)\n- Consent from the parent(s)/guardian(s) (8 states for places selling alcohol; 29 states for private entities)\n- Private entities allowing this act without parental consent (6 states)\n\nApproximately 45 states allow some form of underage consumption of alcohol. If anyone underaged consumes alcohol illegally without a valid excuse, then there will be some severe charges towards them. \n\n## Distribution\nUsually, in addition to consumption, you have to be at least 21-years-old to distribute alcohol in any public establishment. However, there is an exception to this rule that some states follow. \n\nIn certain circumstances, an 18-years-old person can distribute alcohol if the establishment serves food. These types of places are mostly restaurants, grocery stores, and convenience stores. \n\nSome states even have regulations for the type of alcohol an establishment can distribute. Typically, a restaurant can only serve beer and wine. A bar, on the other hand, can distribute liquor and other spirits.\n\nCurrently, the majority of states allow 18-year-olds to serve alcohol. There is one state, Maine, that will allow 17-year-olds to serve alcohol, and there are three states that require servers to be at least 21-years-old to serve alcohol:\n\n- Utah\n- Nevada\n- Alaska\n\n## Intoxication\n\nBeing intoxicated in public will land anyone in hot waters with the law. How severe the punishment will solely depend on the state and city someone resides. It also depends on a personâs blood-alcohol level (BAC) and whether itâs over the legal limit.\n\nThroughout the country, no one should have a BAC of 0.08% or over, especially while driving. If they do, then there are specific punishments that will be imposed, like:\n\n- Fines\n- Having their license revoked\n- Time in jail\n\nSome states also have specific ways of deciding what to charge a person with when theyâre intoxicated in public. Depending on the offense, some states may only charge someone with a misdemeanor. Other states may impose stricter rules and charge intoxicated individuals with a felony. \n","lastModified":"2020-04-20T13:36:55.338Z","path":"alcohol-laws-by-state","name":"Alcohol Laws By State"},{"article":"An alcohol excise tax is usually a tax on a fixed quantity of alcohol. Producers, importers, wholesalers, and sometimes retailers pay alcohol taxes; however, the costs of these taxes are passed down to consumers through increased prices. \r\n\r\nThe excise taxes paid by producers, importers, wholesalers, and retailers increase the amounts used to calculate sales tax; therefore, consumers then pay sale tax on the excise taxes.\r\n\r\nThe federal government collections approximately $1 billion per month from excise alcohol taxes on spirits, beer, and wine. Taxes on spirits are significantly higher than beer and wine at $13.50 per gallon while beer is taxed at $18 per barrel and wine is $1.07-$3.40 per gallon. This is because spirits have higher alcohol content than the other categories. \r\n\r\nIn Wyoming, all wine and spirits must be bought at government monopoly stores. There is no additional state excise tax in Wyoming, and sales tax is typically around 5%. In New Hampshire, all spirits must be bought at government monopoly stores, and the state adds $0.30 in excise tax per gallon of beer and $0.20 to wine, but there are no sales taxes.\r\n\r\nWashington has the highest spirits tax in the United States at $32.52 per gallon.

Think about it â we have smartphones that we carry around with us that could double as computers, and you can use the internet for nearly everything â from finding old classmates to paying your utility bills. While many of us are immersed in this technology, there is a group of people that have shunned this modern technology and live a much simpler lifestyle. That group is the Amish. \n \nThe Amish first made their way to the United States during the 18th century when faced with religious persecution in Europe. However, this religious sect was first established in the 17th century based on the teaching of Jakob Amman, for whom the Amish is named.\n \nThis religious sect lives a very simple life away from urban areas. Most Amish people are farmers, although some delve into other industries such as carpentry and housing construction. Most Amish people do not drive cars, do not use TV, electricity, radios, or computers, and donât go to college or join the military. The children of the sect typically only go to school through the eight grade, with about 90% attending public schools. Amish people also dress quite plainly in clothes in neutral colors with no Velcro or zippers. \n \nThere are significant populations of Amish people in 31 states in the U.S. Estimates show that there are nearly 325,000 Amish people living in the U.S. as of 2018. The largest population is found in the state of Pennsylvania. Based on estimates, over 76,000 Amish people live in this state. Ohio is right behind Pennsylvania with an Amish community made up of over 75,000 people. Indiana has the third highest population of Amish people with nearly 55,000 living within its boundaries. \n \nOther states with an Amish population of at least 10,000 include: \n \n- Wisconsin\n- New York\n- Michigan\n- Missouri\n- Kentucky\n \nThe following states have an Amish population of at least 1,000 but less than 10,000: \n \n- Iowa\n- Illinois\n- Minnesota\n- Tennessee\n- Kansas\n- Delaware\n- Maryland\n- Virginia\n \nThe remaining states have very small populations of Amish people: \n \n- Montana\n- Maine\n- Oklahoma\n- Colorado\n- Nebraska\n- West Virginia\n- Mississippi\n-

After all, who wouldnât love to spend a few dollars and potentially be set up for life with millions of dollars? \n\nUnfortunately, though, there is a dark side to being a lottery winner. People that have scored the jackpot may suddenly find their phones ringing constantly with relatives, friends, and even unknown people asking for loans. They may even start receiving communications from investment brokers and other financial experts that want to take them on as new clients. While this may be annoying, there is also a more sinister side for the lottery winner. Having their identity and newfound wealth disclosed to the public leaves these winners open to robberies, kidnappings, and even murders. \n\nTo protect these winners, some states have allowed big jackpot winners to remain anonymous.

Assisted suicide allows someone to take their own life with the assistance of someone else, such as a doctor. Assisted suicide occurs when someone helps a person with a terminal illness take their own life to avoid suffering.\n\nAssisted suicide and euthanasia are two terms that are used interchangeably. However, there is a distinctly different. When a person is euthanized, another person takes action to end the other personâs life. With assisted suicide, the patient takes their own life, although another individual may provide the medication with which to do so.\n\nAssisted suicide is controversial because it raises questions surrounding ethics and religious beliefs. People who believe that suicide is a sin due to their religion, for example, may be against assisted suicide, even if the terminally ill patient faces extreme pain and suffering.\n\nIn the United States, federal law allows states to make their own choices when it comes to assisted suicide. Because of its controversial nature, it comes as no surprise that assisted suicide is illegal in most states. However, there are a few states where it is legal. Assisted suicide is legal in Washington, D.C., plus the following states:\n\n- California\n- Colorado\n- Hawaii\n- Montana\n- Oregon\n- Vermont\n- Washington\n\nThere are other states where legislation has been proposed, resolutions have been approved, or other steps have been taken to legalize assisted suicide.

This term means that an employer can terminate an employee for any reason without warning. However, an employer can not fire an employee if the reason for doing so is illegal, such as firing someone because of their gender, race, or religion.\n\nContracts in at-will state between employers and employees prevent the employer from pursuing a claim against the employer as a result of being fired. In other words, an employee can not sue for lost wages due to dismissal from the job, provided the dismissal was legal, as discussed above.\n\nThis law doesnât just apply to employers, though. In at-will employment states, employees can also quit their jobs or go on strike without having to provide an explanation.\n\nAll 50 states in the U.S. and Washington, D.C. are at-will employment states. However, some states have exceptions.\n\nOne limitation is the public policy exception. This means that an employer canât fire an employee if it would violate the public policy doctrine of the state or a state or federal statute. An example of this would be retaliation against an employee that performs an action that complies with public policy or an employee that refuses to perform an act that would be a violation of public policy.\n\nForty-two states plus Washington, D.C., have the public policy exception in place. The states that do not are:\n\n- Alabama\n- Florida\n- Georgia\n- Louisiana\n- Maine\n- Nebraska\n- New York\n- Rhode Island\n\nThere is also an implied contract exception. This means that an employee canât be fired when an implied contract is formed between the employee and the employer. This exception is typically difficult to prove, and the burden lies on the fired employee. A total of thirty-six states plus Washington, D.C. have implied contract exceptions. The states that do not are:\n\n- Arizona\n- Delaware\n- Florida\n- Georgia\n- Indiana\n- Louisiana\n- Massachusetts\n- Missouri\n- Montana\n- North Carolina\n- Pennsylvania\n- Rhode Island\n- Texas\n- Virginia\n\nThere are also âimplied-in-lawâ contracts. There is no set definition for this, and courts have interpreted this exception in different ways. For example, one interpretation would prevent an employer from firing a tenured employee to avoid paying retirement benefits.\n\nThere are 11 states with implied-in-law exceptions. Those states are:\n\n- Alabama\n- Alaska\n- Arizona\n- California\n- Delaware\n- Idaho\n- Massachusetts\n- Montana\n- Nevada\n- Utah\n- Wyoming\n\nThere are also statutory exceptions that vary throughout states. This could termination for refusing to engage in illegal activity or taking medical leave.  \n","data":{"states":[],"customMeta":{"columns":["state",{"header":"Public Policy

Typically, there is nothing visually that sets people with ASD apart from anyone else; however, people with ASD may learn, interact, behave, and communicate in ways that are different from most people. \r\n\r\nThe reason that autism is also called autism spectrum disorder is that the disability occurs on a spectrum, with the range and severity of symptoms varying widely. Children or adults with autism might:\r\n\r\n-\tAvoiding contact and wanting to be alone\r\n-\tHaving trouble understand other peopleâs emotions or talking about their own feelings \r\n-\tMight be unaware when people talk to them\r\n-\tHave trouble expressing their needs using typical words\r\n-\tHave trouble adapting when a routine changes\r\n-\tNot look at objects when another person points to them\r\n-\tHave unusual reactions to the way things smell, taste, feel, look, or sound\r\n\r\nDiagnosing autism can be difficult since there is no medical test that can determine the disorder. Autism, however, can sometimes be detected at 18 months or younger and by age two, an experienced professional can usually provide a reliable diagnosis. Early recognition, as well as behavioral, educational, and family therapies may reduce symptoms and support development and learning. \r\n\r\nASD occurs in all racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic groups. ASD is four times more common among boys than among girls. There are several environmental, biological, and genetic factors that make a child more likely to have an ASD, including:\r\n\r\n-\tChildren born to older parents\r\n-\tChildren with a sibling who has ASD\r\n-\tThe prescription drugs valproic acid and thalidomide have been linked with a higher risk of ASD if taken during pregnancy\r\n-\tASD tends to occur more often in people who have certain genetic or chromosomal conditions. \r\n\r\nAccording to the CDCâs [Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring (ADDM) Network](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/67/ss/ss6706a1.htm), about 1 in 59 children has been identified with ASD. About 1 in 28 boys in New Jersey have autism. \r\n\r\nThe [estimated state-level prevalence](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2716402) of ever-diagnosed autism varies from about 1.54% in Texas to 4.88% in Florida. Other states with low prevalence below 2% are Colorado, Alaska, Hawaii, Georgia, Tennessee, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Ohio. Other states with high prevalence above 4% are Rhode Island, Maryland, and Washington D.C. \r\n","data":{"customMeta":{"relatedArticles":["abortion-rates-by-state","autism-rates-by-state","birth-rate-by-state","cancer-rates-by-state","circumcision-rates-by-state","corporate-tax-rates-by-state","crime-rate-by-state","depression-rates-by-state","employment-rate-by-state","flu-rates-by-state","infant-mortality-rate-by-state","labor-force-participation-rate-by-state","maternal-mortality-rate-by-state","murder-rate-by-state","obesity-rate-by-state","smoking-rates-by-state","state-tax-rates","suicide-rates-by-state","teen-pregnancy-rates-by-state","unemployment-rate-by-state","us-literacy-rates-by-state","vaccination-rates-by-state"]}},"lastModified":"2020-04-06T20:09:05.148Z","path":"autism-rates-by-state","name":"Autism Rates By State"},{"article":"The ACT is a standardized exam used for college admissions in the United States. The exam covers four academic areas: English, mathematics, reading, and science. The ACT also has an optional writing portion. \r\n\r\nMany universities require prospective students to take either the ACT or SAT, as standardized tests are believed to be one of the most effective tools for predicting a studentâs success in college. Many schools accept both scores, and typically there is no preference of one exam over the other.\r\n\r\nThe ACT is scored on a scale of 1-36, with 36 being the highest possible score. This scored is calculated by averaging the scaled scores from each of the four subject areas. The scaled scores are translated from the raw score of each section, which is the total number of correct answers. Any averages with decimals are rounded to the nearest whole number. \r\n\r\nMillions of students take the ACT every year. In 2018, only 3,741 students scored a 36 on the exam\r\n\r\nThe score a student receives corresponds to a percentile that compares how you did to the rest of the population of test-takers. Most scores are a little below or a little above the average score. The average ACT score is 20.8. Therefore if you receive a 24 composite score, you are in the 74th percentile and scored higher than 74% of test-takers.\r\n\r\nA âgoodâ score depends on the individual since each person usually has a goal score to achieve to get into the school they plan to apply for. The ACT can be taken and retaken up to 12 times and is administered seven times per year.\r\n\r\nConnecticut has the highest average ACT score of 25.6.

Funeral costs can range based on your location and final wishes of your loved one.\r\n\r\nCosts to factor into a funeral are the hearse, funeral home service fee, casket, headstone, burial plot, viewing and staff fees for any services. If the deceased wished to be cremated, there are separate feeds associated with those services. Funeral costs can be planned for be setting aside a fund or taking out an insurance policy.\r\n\r\nThe average funeral cost is between $7,000 and $9,000, with the median cost being $7,360. Some funerals can cost much higher or lower than the average costs. \r\n\r\nMany families tend to overspend on funerals due to the emotional impact of a loved one passing clouding their best judgment or due to a lack of time and experience. It is important to take the time to research and contact multiple services to see which is right for you and your family and to see what services are within your price range.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, you should know and understand your rights. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) introduced the âFuneral Ruleâ in 1984 which gives you the right to only buy the goods and services you want, be given an itemized statement of all goods and services, be told price information over the phone, and other rights related to your funeral. \r\n\r\nMaine has the highest average funeral cost of $8,675.

This makes the United States the 40th tallest nation in the world. \r\n\r\nMultiple factors contribute to oneâs overall height. Genetics account for 60-80% of oneâs height and nutrition and exercise account for the remaining percentage. Childhood nutrition is believed to be a large factor in adult height. Race plays a large role in average heights in populations. White men (average height of 5 feet 10 inches) and black men (5 feet 9 inches) tend to be taller than Asian (5 feet 7 inches) and Hispanic (5 feet 7 inches) men. Alabama is one of the tallest states in the US and has a population that is 96% black or white. \r\n\r\nTo determine the average height in each of the 50 states, information as pulled from the Center for Disease Controlâs (CDC) [Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System](https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/index.html) (BRFSS). This is an annual survey of more than 450,000 people conducted by the CDC to gather data about health and wellness in the United States, including health-related risk behaviors, chronic health conditions, and the use of preventative services. The BRFSS tracks weight and obesity, healthy eating, physical activity, and height. \r\n\r\nThe tallest states based on average height for men and based on average height for women are different. The tallest women tend to be clustered in the northern plains states with the tallest living in South Dakota. The tallest men live in Iowa and Alabama.\r\n\r\nThe tallest states in the United States based on the average height for men (179 centimeters or above) are:\r\n\r\n-\tAlabama\r\n-\tIowa\r\n-\tKentucky\r\n-\tMontana\r\n-\tNebraska\r\n-\tNorth Dakota\r\n-\tSouth Dakota\r\n-\tTennessee\r\n-\tUtah\r\n-\tWest Virginia\r\n-\tWyoming\r\n\r\nThe tallest states in the United States based on the average height for women (164 centimeters or above) are:\r\n\r\n-\tDistrict of Columbia\r\n-\tIowa\r\n-\tMinnesota\r\n-\tMontana\r\n-\tNebraska\r\n-\tNorth Dakota\r\n-\tOregon\r\n-\tSouth Dakota\r\n-\tUtah\r\n-\tWyoming\r\n\r\nHawaii has the shortest average height among both men and women.

what individuals can and cannot do online. Internet speed is important when surfing the web, playing online games, downloading movies, TV shows, or music, video chatting, or sending any kind of communication. Internet speed also determines how many devices can be connected at once.\r\n\r\nBandwidth measures the total number of frequencies that a network connection can handle at any given moment. Broadband tells you how fast your Internet connection is. Internet speed is measured in bits per second (bps) or megabits per second (Mbps). \r\n\r\nInternet speed is extremely important for entrepreneurs and business owners. A faster Internet can handle more devices at once and help a business run more efficiently.  According to HighSpeedInternet.com, the following Mbps allow users to efficiently do certain tasks:\r\n\r\n-\t5 Mbps: browsing, streaming music; ideal for a single user\r\n-\t10 Mbps: streaming HD videos, casual gaming; ideal for 1-2 people\r\n-\t20 Mbps: Ultra HD streaming, frequent gaming; ideal for 2-4 people\r\n-\t40+ Mbps: steaming multiple shows in HD, simultaneous gaming; ideal for 4+ people\r\n\r\nEvery U.S. state sees significant increases in average Internet speed each year as U.S. telecoms work consistently to provide faster networks. Rural states overall tend to have slower Internet speeds while more densely-populated states tend to have faster internet speeds.\r\n\r\nHighSpeedInternet.com [analyzed one million speed tests](https://www.highspeedinternet.com/tools/speed-test) taken on their site to find out which states and the fastest and slowest average Internet speeds. \r\n\r\nMaryland has the fastest average Internet speed of 65.02 Mbps. Marylandâs fast Internet speeds make it an ideal location for tech businesses, multi-person streaming, and gaming. The next four fastest states are New Jersey (59.58 Mbps), Delaware (59.08 Mbps), Rhode Island (56.77 Mbps), and Virginia (55.98 Mbps). New Jerseyâs fastest city is Somerset, which has an average Internet speed of 97.6 Mbps. Virginiaâs fastest city, Sterling, has an average Internet speed of 96.9 Mbps. \r\n\r\nAll of the five fastest average Internet speeds are located on the East Coast. Because of cheaper costs of living and better Internet speeds, these states provide potentially better start-up environments for businesses than Silicon Valley. \r\n\r\nAlaska has the slowest average Internet speeds of 17.03 Mbps. Speeds under 20 Mbps take longer periods for downloads and only works best for single-user streaming. Following Alaska for the slowest Internet speeds in the country are Mississippi (24.77 Mbps), Idaho (25.30), Montana (25.70), and Maine (26.05). These states are okay for a couple of people to stay connected but are not ideal for businesses or those who are serious gamers. \r\n\r\nAverage Internet speeds and providers for any zip code can be checked on [HighSpeedInternet.com](https://www.highspeedinternet.com/).

As one of many controversial topics in the world, the IQ test is something that people are very divided on, seeing as it is viewed as a way of defining the intelligence levels of people based on one test. \n\nThe argument against the IQ test is that one test cannot accurately predict the intellect of every single person who takes it because people are so different. The thought behind opponents of the IQ test is that there is far too much variety amongst people across the globe, and comparing everyone against the of one test is too simplistic to fully capture people's individual intellect levels. \n\nOn the other side of the controversial topic, many people do believe that the IQ test accurately and appropriately detects people's intelligence levels across the board. So what in the world is an IQ and how do each of the states in the USA compare, based on the average IQ of their citizens? Let's find out! \n\n## The Definition of an Intelligence Quotient\n\n[Intelligence quotients](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/intelligence-quotient) are a measurement in psychological parameters that defines a person's intellect based on their mental age and their actual age. From there, the value that is found after dividing the person's mental age by the person's actual age since birth needs to be multiplied by a value of one hundred. \n\nYou may be wondering how the IQ scores were calculated. How could anyone possibly collect the IQ score of every resident in each of the fifty states and then take the average of each population's total value? That might not be impossible, but it would certainly be time-consuming. So, instead of trying to be precise and inclusive of every age group in a state, researchers actually took a look at the average IQ test scores of anyone in the state who had previously sat through an IQ test in 2015.\n\nThere are online sources that provide interactive IQ test for people to take just for the sake of testing their own IQ scores. Many people take IQ tests when they are considering to apply for Mensa, which is a community of people who fall into the ninety-eighth percentile of intelligence scores on formal, administered intelligence tests. Mensa is a community of people who all share an IQ score that is greater than ninety-eight percent of IQ scores around the world. \n\nBut when it came to the study conducted by the Washington Post, the researchers also took SAT scores, ACT scores, and the estimated number of people who graduated college in each state into consideration. The SAT Is an exam that high school students sit for prior to applying to higher education, as is the ACT. If you have not yet noticed, all of the variables that researchers paid attention to when determining the average IQ of a state had a lot to do with a certain level of education. This is due to the fact that people who are educated tend to score higher on IQ tests than people who never received an education or who stopped attending classes before reaching college. \n\n## States in Order of Average IQ Scores\n\nTo be completely fair and transparent, the intelligence quotient is not the most accurate way of determining someone's intelligence. After all, it is nearly impossible to fully calculate someone's intellect because it is not a variable that is numerically represented. Instead, IQ scores are a way of trying to put a number on someone's intelligence. That disclaimer aside, let's take a look at the values that have been calculated for the average IQ scores of each of the fifty states in America. \n\nFrom the state with the highest intelligence quotient on average to the US state with the lowest IQ score across the board, here is a list of the fifty states in America in order of [average IQ scores](https://www.al.com/news/2016/06/50_states_ranked_by_intelligen.html)...\n\nAs you can see, the highest-ranking state in terms of average IQ is Massachusetts, with an average IQ score of 104.3 and a population of just under seven million people. The state with the lowest IQ score turns out to be Mississippi, with the IQ score of residents coming to about 94.2 on average. There is a difference of 10.1 IQ points between Mississippi and Massachusetts, which is not as drastic of a discrepancy as you might predict thereâd be among fifty states.  \n","frontmatter":{"title":"Average IQ by State"},"data":{"states":["Massachusetts","New Hampshire","North Dakota","Vermont","Minnesota","Maine","Montana"],"customMeta":{"columns":["state",{"header":"Average IQ","field":"averageIQ"}],"sortField":"averageIQ","sortAsc":false,"showAllStates":true,"tileMap":{"field":"averageIQ"},"scatterChartFields":[{"field":"averageIQ","title":"Average IQ","label":"IQ Points"}],"relatedArticles":["average-act-score-by-state","average-funeral-cost-by-state","average-height-by-state","average-temperatures-by-state",{"link":"average-iq-by-state","title":"Average IQ by State"},"average-internet-speed-by-state"]},"customData":[{"state":"Massachusetts","averageIQ":104.3},{"state":"New Hampshire","averageIQ":104.2},{"state":"North Dakota","averageIQ":103.8},{"state":"Vermont","averageIQ":103.8},{"state":"Minnesota","averageIQ":103.7},{"state":"Maine","averageIQ":103.4},{"state":"Montana","averageIQ":103.4},{"state":"Iowa","averageIQ":103.2},{"state":"Connecticut","averageIQ":103.1},{"state":"Wisconsin","averageIQ":102.9},{"state":"Kansas","averageIQ":102.8},{"state":"New Jersey","averageIQ":102.8},{"state":"South Dakota","averageIQ":102.8},{"state":"Wyoming","averageIQ":102.4},{"state":"Nebraska","averageIQ":102.3},{"state":"Virginia","averageIQ":101.9},{"state":"Washington","averageIQ":101.9},{"state":"Ohio","averageIQ":101.8},{"state":"Indiana","averageIQ":101.7},{"state":"Colorado","averageIQ":101.6},{"state":"Pennsylvania","averageIQ":101.5},{"state":"Idaho","averageIQ":101.4},{"state":"Oregon","averageIQ":101.2},{"state":"Utah","averageIQ":101.1},{"state":"Missouri","averageIQ":101},{"state":"New York","averageIQ":100.7},{"state":"Michigan","averageIQ":100.5},{"state":"Delaware","averageIQ":100.4},{"state":"North Carolina","averageIQ":100.2},{"state":"Texas","averageIQ":100},{"state":"Illinois","averageIQ":99.9},{"state":"Maryland","averageIQ":99.7},{"state":"Rhode Island","averageIQ":99.5},{"state":"Kentucky","averageIQ":99.4},{"state":"Oklahoma","averageIQ":99.3},{"state":"Alaska","averageIQ":99},{"state":"West Virginia","averageIQ":98.7},{"state":"Florida","averageIQ":98.4},{"state":"South Carolina","averageIQ":98.4},{"state":"Georgia","averageIQ":98},{"state":"Tennessee","averageIQ":97.7},{"state":"Arkansas","averageIQ":97.5},{"state":"Arizona","averageIQ":97.4},{"state":"Nevada","averageIQ":96.5},{"state":"Alabama","averageIQ":95.7},{"state":"New Mexico","averageIQ":95.7},{"state":"Hawaii","averageIQ":95.6},{"state":"California","averageIQ":95.5},{"state":"Louisiana","averageIQ":95.3},{"state":"Mississippi","averageIQ":94.2}]},"sources":[{"name":"Estimating state IQ: Measurement challenges and preliminary correlates","link":"https://www.ttu.ee/public/m/mart-murdvee/EconPsy/2/McDaniel_2006_Estimating_state_IQ_-_Measurement_challenges_and_preliminary_correlates.pdf"}],"lastModified":"2020-04-06T20:09:05.148Z","path":"average-iq-by-state","name":"Average Iq By State"},{"article":"","data":{"states":[],"customMeta":{"columns":["state",{"header":"Avg.

Income By State"},{"article":"Because of the size of the United States and its varying degrees of latitudes and various geographic features, the country experiences a wide range of climates. Generally, overall temperatures are warmer as one travels further south and the air becomes drier as one moves further west until hitting the west coast. \r\n\r\nThe Southwest region of the U.S. has a hot desert climate at lower elevations. This region experiences high temperatures and dry air and has many vast desert areas. The Southeast region of the country experiences a somewhat sub-tropical climate that includes hot, humid summers (temperatures above 100 are not uncommon) and mild winters. The Northwest is characterized by a diverse climate with bitter, cold winters and somewhat humid, hot summers. The West Coast of the U.S. experiences cool, wet winters and dry, warm summers (with chilly evenings), specifically the further north one goes. The Midwest has humid summers, but winters are long and generally harsh, with temperatures below zero being common, especially in the northern states. \r\n\r\nThe average temperature in the contiguous United States in 2019 was 52.68 degrees Fahrenheit (Â°F).  The [KÃ¶ppen climate classification](https://www.britannica.com/science/Koppen-climate-classification) is used in this article to describe state climates. \r\n\r\n## Coldest States in the U.S.\r\n\r\n#### 1. Alaska\r\nAlaska is the coldest state in the U.S. with an average temperature of 26.6Â°F. Alaska has a subarctic climate. During the winter months, Alaskaâs temperatures can drop as low as -.30Â°F. The Fairbanks area of Alaska experiences an extremely wide range of temperatures throughout the year ranging from -50Â°F in the winter to highs of 90Â°F in the summer. \r\n\r\n#### 2. North Dakota\r\nNorth Dakota is the U.S.âs second-coldest state. The eastern half of North Dakota experiences a humid continental climate and the western half experiences a semi-arid climate. The average temperature in North Dakota is 40.4Â°F, with average temperatures around 24Â°F in the winter. January is North Dakotaâs coldest month when temperatures range from 2Â°F in the northern parts of the state to 17Â°F in the southern parts. \r\n\r\n#### 3. Maine\r\nThe third-coldest state in the United States is Maine, where the average temperature is 41Â°F. Maineâs climate classification is humid continental, as is the majority of New England states. In the winter, the average temperature is 12Â°F. Maine has abundant snowfall in the winter with an average accumulated snowfall of 10 to 80 inches. The most northeastern city in the United State, Caribou, receives even more snowfall and harsher winter temperatures. \r\n\r\n#### 4. Minnesota\r\nMinnesota is the fourth-coldest state in the country. Minnesotaâs humid continental climate is greatly influenced by its proximity to Canada to its north and Lake Superior to its northeast. The average temperature in Minnesota is 41.2Â°F, with temperatures dropping as low at -30Â°F in the northern parts of the state in the month of January. \r\n\r\n#### 5. Wyoming\r\nWyoming is the fifth-coldest state in the United States with an average temperature of 42Â°F. Wyoming has a mostly semi-arid climate. During the winter, the average minimum temperatures range from 0Â°F to 15Â°F. Winds are typically in the 30 to 40 mile per hour range, with gusts up to 50 to 60 miles per hour, significantly reducing the temperature. Additionally, Wyomingâs highlands and mountaintops can receive up to 200 inches of snow per year and lowlands can receive up to 50 inches of snow. \r\n\r\n## Hottest States in the U.S. \r\n\r\n#### 1. Florida\r\nFlorida is the hottest state in the U.S. with an average annual temperature of 70.7Â°F. As the southernmost contiguous state in the U.S., Florida has a sub-tropical climate in its northern and central parts and a tropical climate in its southern parts. Florida has mild winters and extremely hot summers, especially during its hottest month of July, where temperatures reach average highs of 90Â°F to 92Â°F and it is not uncommon for temperatures to hit or go above 100Â°F.\r\n\r\n#### 2. Hawaii\r\nHawaii is the second-hottest state in the United States with an average annual temperature of 70.0Â°F. Hawaii experiences four different KÃ¶ppen climate zones: tropical, arid, temperate, and polar. In the summer, temperatures in Hawaii peak around 84Â°F and typically do not rise above 90Â°F. In the winter, high temperatures are usually around 79Â°F and lows rarely drop below 65Â°F. Hawaii has never recorded a temperature below freezing (32Â°F). \r\n\r\n#### 3. Louisiana\r\nWith an average annual temperature of 66.4Â°F, Louisiana is the third-hottest state in the United States. Louisiana has a subtropical climate with long, hot, and humid summers and short, mild winters. August is Louisianaâs hottest month, where average highs range from 89Â°F to 94Â°F. Louisianaâs position on the Gulf of Mexico gives it a considerable wet season and high humidity that can make the heat feel like 120Â°F.\r\n\r\n#### 4. Texas\r\nTexas is the fourth-hottest state in the United States with an average annual temperature of 65.3Â°F. Texas has arid and semi-arid climates in its west and humid and sub-tropical climates in its east. August is Texasâs hottest month, where average high temperatures are in the 93Â°F to 101Â°F range. In January, Texasâs coldest month, temperatures the average high temperatures are between 52Â°F and 71Â°F. \r\n\r\n#### 5. Georgia\r\nLocated just north of Florida, Georgia is the fifth-hottest state in the United State with an average annual temperature of 63.5Â°F. In its northeast, Georgia has an oceanic climate and a humid subtropical climate in the rest of the state. Summers in Georgia have average highs ranging from 72Â°F to 82Â°F in the northeast region and 90Â°F to 100Â°F in the south. \r\n","data":{"states":[],"customMeta":{"note":"* Numbers are in degrees Fahrenheit (Â°F)","columns":["state",{"header":"Average Temperatures by State","field":"AverageTemperature"},"population"],"sortField":"AverageTemperature","showAllStates":true,"chloroMap":{"field":"AverageTemperature"},"relatedArticles":["average-act-score-by-state","average-funeral-cost-by-state","average-height-by-state","average-temperatures-by-state",{"link":"average-iq-by-state","title":"Average IQ by State"},"average-internet-speed-by-state"]},"customData":[{"state":"Alabama","AverageTemperature":62.8},{"state":"Alaska","AverageTemperature":26.6},{"state":"Arizona","AverageTemperature":60.3},{"state":"Arkansas","AverageTemperature":60.4},{"state":"California","AverageTemperature":59.4},{"state":"Colorado","AverageTemperature":45.1},{"state":"Connecticut","AverageTemperature":49},{"state":"Delaware","AverageTemperature":55.3},{"state":"Florida","AverageTemperature":22.3},{"state":"Georgia","AverageTemperature":63.5},{"state":"Hawaii","AverageTemperature":70},{"state":"Idaho","AverageTemperature":44.4},{"state":"Illinois","AverageTemperature":51.8},{"state":"Indiana","AverageTemperature":51.7},{"state":"Iowa","AverageTemperature":47.8},{"state":"Kansas","AverageTemperature":54.3},{"state":"Kentucky","AverageTemperature":55.6},{"state":"Louisiana","AverageTemperature":66.4},{"state":"Maine","AverageTemperature":41},{"state":"Maryland","AverageTemperature":54.2},{"state":"Massachusetts","AverageTemperature":47.9},{"state":"Michigan","AverageTemperature":44.4},{"state":"Minnesota","AverageTemperature":41.2},{"state":"Mississippi","AverageTemperature":63.4},{"state":"Missouri","AverageTemperature":54.6},{"state":"Montana","AverageTemperature":42.7},{"state":"Nebraska","AverageTemperature":48.8},{"state":"Nevada","AverageTemperature":49.9},{"state":"New Hampshire","AverageTemperature":43.8},{"state":"New Jersey","AverageTemperature":52.7},{"state":"New Mexico","AverageTemperature":53.4},{"state":"New York","AverageTemperature":45.4},{"state":"North Carolina","AverageTemperature":59},{"state":"North Dakota","AverageTemperature":40.4},{"state":"Ohio","AverageTemperature":50.7},{"state":"Oklahoma","AverageTemperature":59.6},{"state":"Oregon","AverageTemperature":48.4},{"state":"Pennsylvania","AverageTemperature":48.8},{"state":"Rhode Island","AverageTemperature":50.1},{"state":"South Carolina","AverageTemperature":62.4},{"state":"South Dakota","AverageTemperature":45.2},{"state":"Tennessee","AverageTemperature":57.6},{"state":"Texas","AverageTemperature":64.8},{"state":"Utah","AverageTemperature":48.6},{"state":"Vermont","AverageTemperature":42.9},{"state":"Virginia","AverageTemperature":55.1},{"state":"Washington","AverageTemperature":48.3},{"state":"West Virginia","AverageTemperature":51.8},{"state":"Wisconsin","AverageTemperature":43.1},{"state":"Wyoming","AverageTemperature":42}]},"lastModified":"2020-04-06T20:09:05.148Z","path":"average-temperatures-by-state","name":"Average Temperatures By State"},{"article":"Blood alcohol concentration (BAC) is the percent of alcohol in a personâs bloodstream. BAC can be measured by a breathalyzer test, blood test or urine test.\r\n\r\nBAC is affected by several factors:\r\n\r\n-\tThe number of standard drinks consumed\r\n-\tAmount of time in which the drinks are consumed\r\n-\tBiological sex\r\n-\tBodyweight\r\n-\tMedications\r\n-\tFood (less important)\r\n\r\n A âstandard drinkâ is one 12 ounces regular beer (4.5% alcohol), one 7 ounce malt liquor (7% alcohol), one 5 ounce glass of wine (12% alcohol), one 1.5 ounce shot of hard liquor (40% alcohol), or .5 ounces of Everclear (95% alcohol). \r\n\r\nThe higher oneâs BAC is, the more intoxicated the individual becomes. A BAC between 0.00% to 0.05% causes mild impairment, where speech, coordination, and balance may be off and relaxation or sleepiness may set in. Between 0.06% and 0.15%, a person will experience increased impairment including increased relaxation, decreased coordination, balance, memory, or speech ability, memory impairments, and significant impairment in all driving skills. A BAC level between 0.16% and 0.30% causes severe impairment to the individual, including increasingly worse speech, coordination, and memory, poor judgment and decision-making, loss of consciousness, and signs of alcohol poisoning such as vomiting. Between 0.31% and 0.45%, a personâs BAC level becomes life-threatening and will show signs of severe alcohol poisoning, loss of consciousness, and risk of death. \r\n\r\nThere are different BAC limits to know and some vary by state. The federal BAC limit to legally drive in the United States is a BAC of 0.08%, meaning that a person is intoxicated under the law (âper seâ BAC limit).  States also have âzero toleranceâ BAC limits, which refer to the level of intoxication considered illegal for drivers under 21. A âzero toleranceâ BAC of 0.00% is sometimes referred to as a ânot-a-dropâ law. In some states, a driver under 21 with a BAC between 0.02% and 0.08% will face a different type of DUI and penalties. Enhanced penalty BAC is the BAC level at which an intoxicated person will face worse penalties (increased penalties). \r\n\r\nIn addition to these BAC limits, every state has an implied consent law where motorists are assumed to have given their consent to have their BAC tested. Lastly, most states have an âactual physical controlâ law that states that a person does not need to be actually driving to be in physical control of the vehicle; therefore, a person can still receive a DUI if in the driverâs seat, behind the steering wheel, in possession of the ignition key, and in a position that he or she is physically capable of starting the vehicle and putting the vehicle in motion. \r\n\r\nThe information presented here is for informational purposes only. To learn about BAC limits and DUI penalties in your state, it is best to consult a DUI attorney. \r\n\r\n## BAC Limits by State\r\n\r\n#### Alabama\r\nIn Alabama, the per se BAC is 0.08%, with increased penalties at 0.15%.

The âboxâ in âban-the-boxâ initially referred to the checkbox on a job application where candidates would have to answer whether or not they have a criminal history, but these regulations have expanded to indicate when an employer is permitted to ask about criminal history.\n\nThe purpose of a ban-the-box law is to help those adults with a criminal past receive a fair chance of finding work. Employers are encouraged to assess a candidateâs qualifications and skills fairly against other candidates before denying employment. Some employers are exempt from ban the box laws, such as security jobs, and those working with children and the elderly.\n\nBefore these laws, a typical job application had a set of questions that included the question, âHave you ever been convicted of a crime? Check yes or no.â For the 30% of adults who do have a criminal history, checking this box usually meant that their application was automatically rejected by the employer without evaluation of their crime or any of their qualifying skills or work history.\n\nA total of 35 states and the District of Columbia have adopted a ban the box law of some kind. Thirteen of these states have extended their law to private employers. 150 cities and 18 counties have also adopted some type of ban-the-box law, some of which are in states that have not adopted such laws. This sets 258 million people in the US in a jurisdiction with a ban-the-box or fair-chance law.

Some laws only apply to employers of a specific size, and some require employers to wait until a later point in the hiring process to ask about criminal histories, such as after a conditional offer is made.\n\nBelow is a list of all 35 Ban-the-Box states and their regulations. Some municipalities that have separate ban-the-box laws have been included.

The focus of the cow-calf operation is to maintain a herd of beef cattle to raise calves. The cattle feeding sector focuses on preparing cattle for various means of production. \r\n \r\nBeef cattle are raised in all 50 U.S. states. All cattle and calves in the United States totaled 94.4 million as of January 1, 2020. In 2020, the projected beef production is 27.48 billion pounds. \r\n\r\nThe number of cattle in every state is a good indicator of how much beef each state produces.  Thirty states have over 1 million head of cattle, fourteen of those states have over 2 million, and nine of those states have over 3 million. \r\n\r\n## States with the Most Cattle\r\n\r\n#### 1. Texas\r\nTexas has about 13 million head of cattle, about 13.77% of the total cattle in the United States. Texas has the second-largest economy in the nation behind California, with agriculture being one of its most important sectors. Unsurprisingly, cattle are the stateâs top commodity, accounting for over half of the stateâs total market value of all commodities. Since 1967, Texas has had 11 million head of cattle or more every year with the highest being 16.6 million head.\r\n\r\n#### 2. Nebraska\r\nNebraska has the second-highest number of cattle in the U.S. of 6.8 million head. This comprises about 7.20% of the total headcount in the United States. Nebraskaâs beef industry has a $12.1 billion contribution to its economy and the state has about 4,570 cattle feeding operations statewide. Nebraska consistently has more cattle in the state than it does people. \r\n\r\n#### 3. Kansas\r\nKansas is home to 6.83% of the United State cattle or 6.45 million heads. The beef cattle sector is the single largest sector in the Kansas agriculture industry. According to the [Kansas Department of Agriculture](https://agriculture.ks.gov/docs/default-source/ag-growth-summit/january-2018-documents/beef-sector.pdf?sfvrsn=143c80c1_20), beef cattle farming and ranching has a direct output of approximately $6.3 billion and employs over 34,000 Kansas residents. Beef and beef product exports from Kansas account for about 18-26% of total U.S. beef exports. \r\n\r\n#### 4. California\r\nCalifornia has the fourth-highest number of cattle in the United States of 5.2 million. This is about 5.51% of the total U.S. cattle. California is the nationâs top agricultural state overall. In 2017, cattle and calves generated about $3.2 billion in revenue and the state was home to 13,694 cattle ranches. \r\n\r\n#### 5. Oklahoma\r\nOklahoma also has about 5.2 million cattle, tied with California as having the fourth-highest number. Even with such a large number of cattle, about 97% of operations are family-owned and operated. The beef industry is the stateâs largest agriculture segment and is valued at approximately $4.8 billion.\r\n\r\n#### 6. Missouri\r\nMissouri has the sixth-highest number of cattle in the United States with 4.35 million head. This is about 4.61% of the total U.S. cattle. Missouri is also one of the top states for herd expansion. Missouriâs beef industry directly provides over 45,000 jobs and supports over 72,000 jobs (directly, indirectly, or induced). \r\n\r\n#### 7. Iowa\r\nIowa has the seventh-highest number of cattle with 3.9 million, about 4.13% of the total U.S. cattle. In 2017, Iowaâs cattle industry contributed over $6.8 billion in business activity to the stateâs economy. Jobs directly and indirectly related to the cattle industry and jobs induced by the cattle industry total 33,147. In 2018, Iowaâs beef and beef variety exports totaled 2.983 billion pounds. \r\n\r\n#### 8. South Dakota\r\nSouth Dakota ties with Iowa as having the seventh-highest number of cattle with 3.9 million head. There are about 17,000 ranch and cattlemen that produce these 3.9 million head of cattle, with the majority of them are in family businesses. The direct impact of the beef industries in South Dakota is $2.284 billion and over 12,500 full-time jobs. \r\n\r\n#### 9. Wisconsin\r\nWisconsin has a total of 3.45 million head of cattle, comprising about 3.65% of the United Stateâs total. Wisconsinâs beef industry provides 35,100 jobs and contributes $2.1 billion in total income to the stateâs economy. Additionally, the beef industry allows more than $200 million to be provided annually to state and local governments through income, sales, and property taxes.\r\n\r\n#### 10. Colorado\r\nFinishing the top ten beef producers is Colorado, which has 2.8 million head of cattle or 2.97% of the U.S. total. There are about 11,267 beef cattle farms in Colorado, 91% of which are family or individually owned. Colorado is the fourth-largest exporter of fresh and frozen beef in the United States. Coloradoâs leading producer of beef is Weld County. \r\n","data":{"customMeta":{"relatedArticles":["beef-production-by-state","corn-production-by-state","oil-production-by-state","wine-production-by-state"]}},"lastModified":"2020-04-06T20:09:05.148Z","path":"beef-production-by-state","name":"Beef Production By State"},{"article":"Whether youâre a soon-to-be college student trying to figure out your next move after high school graduation or you have children in your household, thereâs one thing that both have in common: the desire to find the best schools.\n\nA great school system is a selling point for homes on the market, and college students are willing to pay extra money to attend out-of-state schools. These examples are just two that show how important education is to many people.\n\nWhile there are great schools in every state in the U.S., some states have exceptional school districts and institutions of higher learning that stand out above the rest.\n\nThere isnât just one set list of the best schools, however. Many publications and think tanks have created their own lists of the best schools for education based on a number of factors.\n\nOne such list was created by U.S. News \u0026 World Report. The 2018 Education Rankings is based 50% on higher education factors such as graduation rates and tuition costs. The remaining 50% is based on Pre-K through 12, using factors such as test scores and high school graduation rates.\n\nBased on this list, Massachusetts came in first place. Coming in right behind was New Jersey, followed by Utah taking the third slot. The top 10 states for the best education based on this report were:\n\n- Massachusetts\n- New Jersey\n- Utah\n- New Hampshire\n- Iowa\n- Washington\n- Florida\n- Vermont\n- Nebraska\n- North Dakota\n\nEducation Weekâs Quality Counts report of 2018 is another report that ranks the best states in the nation. Massachusetts and New Jersey also topped this list. However, Vermont took third place. Based on this report, the top states for education were:\n\n- Massachusetts\n- New Jersey\n- Vermont\n- New Hampshire\n- Connecticut\n- Maryland\n- Wyoming\n- Pennsylvania\n- New York\n- Minnesota\n\nThis report took a look at high school graduation rates, public school spending, the number of adults with a bachelorâs degree or higher, and adults with incomes that are above national levels.\n\nYet another report was compiled by WalletHub. This report focused more on the K-12 public school systems.\n\nTopping this list was, again, Massachusetts. This was followed by New Jersey in second place and Connecticut in third. The top 10 states for education based on this list were:\n\n- Massachusetts\n- New Jersey\n- Connecticut\n- New Hampshire\n- Vermont\n- Virginia\n- Minnesota\n- Maryland\n- Wisconsin\n- Colorado\n\nAs you can see, there are many states that appear on all three lists. However, the different criteria considered has changed the order or added states that werenât on another list.\n\nWhen selecting a state with the best schools, itâs best to figure out whatâs most important for your situation and look at data surrounding that. For example, if your focus is on K-12 public schools, look at research and data focused on these schools. If youâre trying to figure out where to go to college, consider data and information surrounding factors such as tuition costs and graduation rates.\n","data":{"states":["Massachusetts","New

shootings. While there are citizens and politicians that are very vocal about increasing gun control and even banning guns completely, there are also many citizens that believe that everyone in the United States has the right to bear arms as outlined in the Second Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. \n \nGun laws are not determined by the federal government. Instead, each state determines the requirements for obtaining a gun, as well as the requirements for open and concealed carry. While there arenât any states that have banned gun ownership, there are states that have âmay issueâ policies that make it difficult for average citizens to obtain and own a gun. \n \nIn this article, however, weâre going to focus on the states that donât have such strict laws regarding owning or carrying a gun. These are considered the best states for gun owners. \n \nAlaska: Does not require a permit, purchase permit, or registration. There are no background checks on private fun sales, and open carry is allowed without a permit. \n\nArizona: No permit, purchase permit, or registration is required in this state. There are no background checks performed for private gun sales. Open carry is legal in Arizona. There are also no restrictions on magazine size in this state. \n\nIdaho: In Idaho, residents of the state do not need a permit. However, non-residents are required to have a permit for concealed carry within Idahoâs cities. No purchase permits or registrations are required. Open carry is allowed, and there are no magazine size restrictions. Idaho also does not require a background check for private sales. \n\nKansas: There is no carry permit, purchase permit, or registration required in Kansas. Open carry is allowed without a permit. No background checks for private gun sales or magazine size restrictions apply in this state. \n\nMaine: Maine does not require carry permits, purchase permits, or firearm registration. Open carry is permitted, while there is not a requirement to run a background check for a private sale. Magazine sizes are also not restricted. \n\nMississippi: No carry permit is required if a gun is carried in a holster, satchel, purse, handbag, or sheath. Mississippi does not require purchase permits, registration, or background checks on private sales. Open carry is legal, and there are no restrictions on magazine sizes. \n\nMissouri: No carry permit is required although residents can obtain a permit to be exempted from laws passed by local authorities. Missouri does not require purchase permits or registration, and background checks do not have to be performed during a private sale. This state allows open carry and does not restrict magazine size. \n\nNew Hampshire: This state doesnât require a carry permit, registration, or purchase permit. Open carry is allowed, but long guns located in vehicles canât be loaded. A background check is not required for a private sale. Magazine size is not restricted. \n\nVermont: This state does not issue or require carry permits. It also does not require purchase permits or registration. Vermont does, however, require ales only through licensed dealers unless the sale is to a family member. Open carry is allowed in Vermont. Vermont does put restrictions on magazine size. \n\nWest Virginia: This state does not require carry permits, purchase permits, or registration. Open carry is allowed. There are no restrictions on magazine size. There are also no laws that require background checks on private sales. \n\nWyoming: Residents are not required to get a carry permit. However, non-residents must get a permit to conceal carry. The state does not limit the size of magazines, does not require background checks for private sales, and doesnât require purchase permits or registration. Open carry is allowed in this state. \n\n","data":{"states":["Alaska","Arizona","Idaho","Kansas","Maine","Mississippi","Missouri","New Hampshire","Vermont","West Virginia","Wyoming"],"customMeta":{"relatedArticles":["best-states-for-gun-owners","concealed-carry-states","concealed-carry-reciprocity-states","constitutional-carry-states","gun-deaths-by-state","gun-deaths-per-capita-by-state","gun-laws-by-state","gun-ownership-by-state","gun-violence-by-state","guns-per-capita","magazine-capacity-laws-by-state","open-carry-states"]}},"sources":[{"name":"Best States for Gun Owners (2018)","link":"https://www.gunsandammo.com/editorial/best-states-for-gun-owners-2018/327233"}],"lastModified":"2020-04-06T20:09:05.148Z","path":"best-states-for-gun-owners","name":"Best States For Gun Owners"},{"article":"Being an educator is one of the most important jobs a person can hold. After all, without teachers, children wouldnât gain the crucial skills and knowledge they need to become successful adults.\n\nHowever, in many states across the nation, teachers have low salaries, no support from school administrators, and work high-pressure jobs. A study from the National Center for Education Statistics shows that nearly one-fifth of teachers donât last more than one year in their job due to the high stress and low pay. The study further indicates that almost half donât make it to five years.\n\nFortunately, though, there are states that recognize the value of educators. Several studies have been conducted to find the best states for teachers. In terms of income, the top state is New York, which pays teachers an average of over $76,000 per year. Alaska comes in behind New York as the state with the second-highest salary for teachers. Connecticut, California, and Massachusetts also have high average salaries for educators.\n\nHowever, this doesnât show the full picture. Many of these states, including Alaska and New York, have a cost of living that is higher than the national average. Even though these teachers are making more money, the price of everything from housing to utilities and groceries is much higher than in other states.\n\nTo get a more comprehensive look at the best states for teachers, we can take a look at a [study conducted by WalletHub](https://wallethub.com/edu/best-and-worst-states-for-teachers/7159/). This study looked at 22 indicators including safety and income growth potential to determine which states are the most teacher-friendly.\n\nTeacher salaries are based on [data from the 2017-2018 school year](https://www.businessinsider.com/teacher-salary-in-every-state-2018-4#6-new-jersey-46). \n\n## 10 Best States for Teachers\n\n#### 1. North Dakota\nNorth Dakota is the best state for teachers in the United States according to WalletHubâs findings. North Dakota ranked 11th for âOpportunity \u0026 Competitionâ and third for âAcademic \u0026 Work Environment.â North Dakota has the second-lowest pupil-to-teacher ratio of any state, which is important because it allows teachers to better manage their classes and provide individual attention to each student. The average teacher salary in North Dakota is $54,421 per year. \n\n#### 2. New Jersey\nNew Jersey is the second-best state for teachers in the nation, ranking first for âAcademic \u0026 Work Environment.â New Jersey has the third-lowest pupil-to-teacher ratio and the fourth-highest public school spending per student, spending about $21,866 per student. New Jerseyâs public school systems are also ranked second in the U.S. The average teacher salary in New Jersey is $69,917, the sixth-highest in the country. \n\n#### 3. Pennsylvania\nPennsylvania is the third-best state for teachers in the U.S. Pennsylvania ranks second for âOpportunity \u0026 Competitionâ and 10th for âAcademic \u0026 Work Environment.â Pennsylvania has the ninth-highest teacher salary of any state of $67,398, which is the second-highest when adjusted for cost of living. Pennsylvania teachers believe the state needs to work on teacher starting salaries and pensions as areas of improvement. \n\n#### 4. Wyoming\nWyoming is the fourth-best state overall for teachers, ranking fourth for âAcademic \u0026 Work Environmentâ as well. The state has the sixth-best pupil-to-teacher ratio among all 50 states and the seventh-highest amount of public funding per student. Additionally, Wyoming teachers have the highest average starting salary for new teachers and one of the lowest staff turnover rates. The average teacher salary in Wyoming is $58,578.\n\n#### 5. Connecticut\nConnecticut ranks fifth for the best states for teachers. Connecticut ranks second for âAcademic \u0026 Work Environmentâ and ranks third for the best school systems behind New Jersey and Massachusetts. The state is also known for having small class sizes, some of the best-paid teachers, and full retirement benefits that are favorable enough to incentivize about 55% of teachers to continue working until they qualify for a pension. The average teacher salary in Connecticut is $73,113 \n\n#### 6. Illinois\nIllinois is the sixth-best state for teachers in the U.S. overall and also ranks sixth for âOpportunity \u0026 Competition,â with the second-best income growth potential for teachers among all 50 states. Additionally, Illinois school systems rank 12th for public school spending per student. The average teacher salary in Illinois is $65,776.\n\n#### 7. Minnesota\nMinnesota is ranked both seventh-best overall for teachers and seventh for âAcademic \u0026 Work Environment.â Minnesotaâs public schools are ranked as some of the best in the country, with the second-highest math and highest median SAT scores of any state. The average teacher salary in Minnesota is $57,782 per year. \n\n#### 8. Massachusetts\nThe eighth-best state for teachers in the United States is Massachusetts. Massachusetts is ranked fifth for âAcademic \u0026 Work Environment.â Massachusetts has the best public school systems in the U.S. The state is also the fifth-biggest spender per student. Massachusetts is also the most educated state in the country. The average teacher salary in the state is $79,710. \n\n#### 9. Utah\nUtah is the ninth-best state for teachers in the U.S. Utah is ranked eighth for âOpportunity \u0026 Competition.â Despite being one of the best states for teachers, Utah has the second-lowest public school spending per student and the third-highest pupil-to-teacher ratio, which is likely because the state has a teacher short of about 1,600. The average annual teacher salary in Utah is $47,604, the fourth-lowest in the country.\n\n#### 10. New York\nNew York finishes the ten best states for teachers. New York is ranked sixth for âAcademic \u0026 Work Environmentâ with the fourth-lowest projected teacher turnover. New York has the highest public school spending per student of $23,091. New York also has the highest average annual teacher salary of $83,585. \n\n","data":{"states":["New York","Connecticut","Minnesota","Illinois","North Dakota","Pennsylvania","Wyoming","New

Because we all have opinions on what makes something the âbest,â itâs hard to determine exactly what state is the best to live.\n\nHowever, some publications and organizations have done their research, looked at various factors, and have created lists of the best states in the United States. One of the most comprehensive records is the Best States Ranking by U.S. News \u0026 World Report. \n\nThis list looks at multiple points of data to determine the best states in the nation. Metrics include health care, education, the economy, infrastructure, quality of life, state fiscal stability, crime and corrections (public safety), and natural environment to determine the best states. The full methodology used to determine the best states can be found [here.](https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/articles/methodology)\n\nHere is a list of the top ten best states to live in the United States:\n\n#### 1.

people that settle down to have a family want to find the best place to raise their children. Some people move from the busy city to the more relaxed suburbs or rural areas. Others move from states with high costs of living to ones that are more affordable in terms of cost-of-living and college tuition prices. \n \nThere isnât a universal way to determine which states are the best for raising a family. After all, you could probably find people from all 50 states that would tout the benefits of raising a family within their own states. However, a new study from MoneyRates.com examines a few different factors to determine which states are the highest ranked for raising a family. \n \nThis study took a look at different factors including college tuition expenses, the overall cost of living, as well as access to child-friendly amenities such as parks and libraries. \n \nAccording to this study, Utah is the best state to raise a family. This is primarily due to its low college tuition costs, which are the third lowest in the nation. Utah is also one of the safest states due to a low occurrence of violent crimes, and the state is home to a variety of family-friendly amenities. \n \nComing in second is the state of Wyoming, which has the cheapest public college tuition rates in the entire nation for in-state students. This state also has a low rate of violent crime and a general low cost of living. \n \nNew Jersey, despite its high cost of living, is the third best state for raising a family based on this study. New Jersey has many family-friendly neighborhoods and amenities and excellent school systems. \n \nVirginia is also near the top of the list at fourth place. Even though its college tuition rates are higher than many other states, factors including low rates of violent crime, quality childhood education, and childrenâs health programs make this one of the best states for raising a family. \n \nIn fifth place in the study is Idaho. This state is one of the safest for raising children and also offers low tuition rates for college. However, one thing to note is that there arenât as many family-friendly amenities as there are in other top-ranking states. \n \nThese are the top five states for raising a family in the United States. Other states that ranked highly in this study include: \n \nMinnesota\nIowa\nOhio\nWisconsin\nSouth Dakota\n\n","data":{"states":["Minnesota","Massachusetts","North Dakota","Vermont","New

All of the years of hard work will be behind us, and weâll be able to begin to enjoy the fruits of our labors. Some of us have even planned where we will retire. Maybe itâs a state known for warm sunshine or beautiful beaches. Perhaps itâs a state with rolling fields and beautiful countryside. Perhaps you want to retire in a beautiful condo in the middle of all of the action.\n\nWhether retirement is many years away or youâre counting down the days, itâs never too early or too late to begin researching your options for retirement â starting with the states that are ranked as the best for retirement.\n\nItâs important to note that there is no definitive measure of the best state for retirement. However, some publications and think tanks have used several factors to compile their lists of the best states for retirement.\n\nKiplinger created one list. The factors used to determine the ranking of all 50 states include living expenses, health care costs, poverty rates, and the economic wellness of the state.\n\nBelow are the ten best states for retirement.\n\n#### 1. South Dakota\n\nSouth Dakota ranks as the best state for retirement in the United States. The average cost of living in South Dakota is 4% below the national average, including healthcare costs. South Dakota has one of the highest numbers of arts, entertainment, and recreation businesses per capita. The average annual spending for a comfortable retirement is about $60,998.  Additionally, South Dakota is the third-most tax-friendly state in the U.S. with no state income tax, which means Social Security benefits and other retirement income are not taxed.\n\n#### 2. Hawaii\n\nHawaii is the second-best state for retirement in the country. Although Hawaii has the highest cost of living in the United States, the average household income for people ages 65 and older is 33.8% above the national average at $71,997 and healthcare costs are 11.4% below the national average. Hawaii also has a beautiful landscape that many retirees consider to be their ideal retirement location.\n\n#### 3. Georgia\n\nGeorgia is the third-best state for retirement. Georgiaâs cost of living is about 7% below the national average and has the sixth-lowest average cost for a retired couple in the U.S. Georgia also has favorable tax conditions. Social security is exempt from state taxes in Georgia, as well as up to $35,000 of most types of retirement income for those between 62 and 64, and up to $65,000 per taxpayer 65 and older ($130,000 per couple). Combine all of that with warm summers and mild winters and Georgia is an ideal retirement state. \n\n#### 4. North Dakota\n\nNorth Dakota is the fourth-best state for retirement in the U.S. The cost of living in North Dakota is just 1% above the national average, but average healthcare costs for a retired couple are below average at $414,455. The annual spending for a comfortable retirement in the state is about $61,222 and it is considered to be tax-friendly with state income tax ranging from 1.01% to 2.9% and property taxes are 1.01%.\n\n#### 5. Tennessee\n\nTennessee ranks fifth for the best states to retire, especially for budget-conscious retirees. Tennesseeâs cost of living is 12% below the U.S. average and the state does not levy state income taxes, helping retirement income go further. Tennesseeâs annual spending for a comfortable retirement is $55,425, the seventh-lowest in the country. \n\n#### 6. Alabama\n\nAlabama is the sixth-best state for retirement in the United States. Alabama has mild winters, beaches, and golf topped off by a cost of living that is 13% below the national average. Alabamaâs highest state income tax rate is only 5%, and Social Security benefits and income from traditional pension plans are exempt from income tax. Additionally, Alabama has the second-lowest property taxes in the U.S. at a rate of 0.42% and all homeowners 65 or older are exempt from state property taxes.\n\n#### 7. Virginia\n\nThe seventh-best state for retirement is Virginia. The beautiful scenery and charm of Virginia, unfortunately, come with a cost of living 7% above the U.S. average; however, the average income for households 65 and older is $59,869 to cover it. Additionally, healthcare costs for a retired couple are below average at $408,950. Virginia does not tax Social Security benefits and those 65 and older can deduct up to $12,000 per person. \n\n#### 8. Florida\n\nFlorida is the eighth-best state for retirement. Florida has the highest share of seniors of any state in the U.S. comprising 19.1% of the population. Florida has warm winters, miles of beaches, and a cost of living that is about average. Florida has no state income tax, estate tax, or inheritance tax and the state does not tax Social Security or other retirement income. \n\n#### 9. New Hampshire\n\nNew Hampshire ranks ninth for the best state for retirement. New Hampshire has a cost of living that is 18% above the national average; however, this is partially balanced out by the tax situation. New Hampshire does not tax Social Security benefits or other retirement income and does not levy any sales tax. Additionally, New Hampshire ranks fifth in the country for the best senior healthcare. \n\n#### 10. Utah\n\nUtah finishes the top ten list of best retirement states. Utah is a great state for retirees who love to be outdoors and stay active with five national parks, five national forests, and 43 state parks. Utah ranks second out of all 50 states for the overall health of its senior population. While the cost of living is slightly above average (4% above) and Utah isnât tax-friendly, it has the third-lowest poverty rate in the U.S. for people 65 and older. \n","data":{"states":["South Dakota","Hawaii","Georgia","North Dakota","Tennessee","Alabama","Virginia","Florida","New Hampshire","Utah"],"customMeta":{"columns":["state",{"header":"Annual Spending for Comfortable Retirement","field":"retirementCost","format":"moneyWithCurrency"},"population"],"sortAsc":true,"sortField":"retirementCost","showAllStates":true,"chloroMap":{"thresholds":["min",56000,60000,65000,70000,85000,"max"],"field":"retirementCost","reverseColors":true},"relatedArticles":["best-states-for-education","best-states-for-gun-owners","best-states-for-teachers","best-states-to-live-in","best-states-to-raise-a-family","best-states-to-retire","states-with-the-best-weather","worst-drivers-by-state","worst-states-to-live-in","worst-states-to-retire"]},"customData":[{"state":"Alabama","retirementCost":55425.11},{"state":"Alaska","retirementCost":80877.32},{"state":"Arizona","retirementCost":60503.17},{"state":"Arkansas","retirementCost":54743.91},{"state":"California","retirementCost":85893.44},{"state":"Colorado","retirementCost":65333.51},{"state":"Connecticut","retirementCost":79762.62},{"state":"Delaware","retirementCost":65643.15},{"state":"District of Columbia","retirementCost":100879.9},{"state":"Florida","retirementCost":61246.3},{"state":"Georgia","retirementCost":56477.88},{"state":"Hawaii","retirementCost":117724.18},{"state":"Idaho","retirementCost":58335.71},{"state":"Illinois","retirementCost":59264.62},{"state":"Indiana","retirementCost":55796.68},{"state":"Iowa","retirementCost":56849.45},{"state":"Kansas","retirementCost":55548.97},{"state":"Kentucky","retirementCost":56849.45},{"state":"Louisiana","retirementCost":57964.14},{"state":"Maine","retirementCost":72579.03},{"state":"Maryland","retirementCost":81310.81},{"state":"Massachusetts","retirementCost":82859},{"state":"Michigan","retirementCost":55301.26},{"state":"Minnesota","retirementCost":62856.41},{"state":"Mississippi","retirementCost":53071.87},{"state":"Missouri","retirementCost":54991.62},{"state":"Montana","retirementCost":64404.6},{"state":"Nebraska","retirementCost":57778.36},{"state":"Nevada","retirementCost":67067.48},{"state":"New Hampshire","retirementCost":67686.76},{"state":"New Jersey","retirementCost":75861.19},{"state":"New Mexico","retirementCost":57468.72},{"state":"New York","retirementCost":84035.62},{"state":"North Carolina","retirementCost":58211.85},{"state":"North Dakota","retirementCost":61122.44},{"state":"Ohio","retirementCost":57468.72},{"state":"Oklahoma","retirementCost":54558.13},{"state":"Oregon","retirementCost":81248.88},{"state":"Pennsylvania","retirementCost":61060.52},{"state":"Rhode Island","retirementCost":75861.19},{"state":"South Carolina","retirementCost":60874.73},{"state":"South Dakota","retirementCost":60998.59},{"state":"Tennessee","retirementCost":55425.11},{"state":"Texas","retirementCost":56539.81},{"state":"Utah","retirementCost":60812.81},{"state":"Vermont","retirementCost":73507.94},{"state":"Virginia","retirementCost":63166.05},{"state":"Washington","retirementCost":67810.61},{"state":"West Virginia","retirementCost":58645.34},{"state":"Wisconsin","retirementCost":59326.55},{"state":"Wyoming","retirementCost":56044.39}]},"sources":[{"name":"The 20 Best States for Your Retirement","link":"https://www.kiplinger.com/slideshow/retirement/T006-S001-best-states-for-retirement-2018/index.html"}],"lastModified":"2020-04-06T20:09:05.148Z","path":"best-states-to-retire","name":"Best States To Retire"},{"article":"The Bible Belt is a region located in the southern United States.

Mencken used the word in an article appearing in the Chicago Daily Tribune. Later, Mencken claimed to be the inventor of the term.\n\nThe number of religious citizens living in the Bible Belt region is dramatically higher when compared to other areas of the U.S. For example; the most non-religious citizens reside in Vermont. Thirty-seven percent of people that live in Vermont state they are non-religious. Compare this to Alabama, the Bible Belt state with the highest percentage of residents identifying as non-religious at just 12%.\n\nWhile there are a few definitions of what states make up the Bible Belt, itâs accepted that the following states are included:\n\n- Alabama\n- Arkansas\n- Georgia\n- Kentucky\n- Louisiana\n- Mississippi\n- North Carolina\n- Oklahoma\n- South Carolina\n- Tennessee\n- Texas\n- Utah\n\nTwo cities even are known as the Buckle of the Bible Belt.

The birth rate is used in conjunction with the mortality and migration rates to calculate population growth. \r\n\r\nBirth rate is often used interchangeably with fertility rate; however, fertility rate is the number of births per 1,000 women of childbearing age (ages 15 to 44) occurring in a particular year. \r\n\r\nThe birth rate is a concern for some governments. Some governments around the world are attempting to increase the birth rate with financial incentives or offering support services to new mothers. This is due to these countries having birth rates lower than their mortality rates, resulting in a declining population. Other governments, however, have the opposite problem of high birth rates that are causing overpopulation. This is seen in Chinaâs [one-child policy.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-child_policy)\r\n\r\nAdditionally, high birth rates are typically associated with low life expectancy, low living standards and education levels, and low social status for women. Some policies to low the birth rate in some countries have focused on improving womenâs rights and sexual and reproductive health. Improved information and access to birth control methods have achieved good results in Iran and Bangladesh. \r\n\r\nAccording to the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)](https://www.cdc.gov/), the U.S. birth rate was the lowest in 2018 than it has been in 32 years. The CDCâs [report](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/vsrr/vsrr-007-508.pdf) states that the total number of births in 2018 was down 2% from 2017. These numbers are lower than they were after the Great Depression. \r\n\r\nSeveral reasons are cited for the decline in the birth rate. More Americans are delaying marriage and having children as a result of pursuing higher education and focusing on building careers before building families. Additionally, there are fewer teen pregnancies and greater education and availability of contraception. \r\n\r\nAmerican women in their 30s have a higher birthrate for 2017 and 2018 than women in their 20s. Because of the 36.6 million American jobs lost between January 2009 to December 2017, some couples do not want children because they are unsure if they will have stable jobs in the future. \r\n\r\nWith a total fertility rate of 1.8 births per woman and only 3,788,235 babies born in 2018, the U.S. reproducing is below a viable replacement rate, which it has fallen short of since 1971. The U.S. population growth, therefore, relies on immigration.  \r\n\r\nThe U.S. birthrate is 11.6 per 1,000 population. The birth rate varies from state to state. [The National Vital Statistics System report from the CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr68/nvsr68_13-508.pdf) lays out each stateâs birth rate, along with the fertility rate, total fertility rate, and fertility rate by age group of the mother. \r\n\r\nThe states with the lowest birth rates are:\r\n\r\n1.\tVermont (8.7)\r\n2.\tNew Hampshire (8.8)\r\n3.\tMaine (9.2)\r\n4.\tConnecticut (9.7)\r\n5.\tRhode Island (9.9)\r\n6.\tMassachusetts (10.0)\r\n7.\tOregon (10.1)\r\n8.\tWest Virginia (10.1)\r\n9.\tFlorida (10.4)\r\n10.\tPennsylvania (10.6)\r\n\r\nVermont has the lowest birth rate in the United States of 8.7 per 1,000 population. The six states with the lowest birth rates in the country are located in the northeast. These states will likely see their populations shrink between 2030 and 2040. \r\n\r\nThe states with the highest birth rates are:\r\n\r\n1.\tUtah (14.9)\r\n2.\tNorth Dakota (14.0)\r\n3.\tAlaska (13.7)\r\n4.\tSouth Dakota (13.5)\r\n5.\tTexas (13.2)\r\n6.\tNebraska (13.2)\r\n7.\tDistrict of Columbia (13.1)\r\n8.\tOklahoma (12.6)\r\n9.\tKansas (12.5)\r\n10.\tMississippi (12.4)\r\n\r\nUtah has the highest birth rate in the United States of 14.9 per 1,000 population. This is likely because of Utahâs large Mormon population, which is also the reason that Utah has the largest average household size in the country and the lowest median age in the country of 29.2. \r\n\r\n","data":{"customMeta":{"relatedArticles":["abortion-rates-by-state","autism-rates-by-state","birth-rate-by-state","cancer-rates-by-state","circumcision-rates-by-state","corporate-tax-rates-by-state","crime-rate-by-state","depression-rates-by-state","employment-rate-by-state","flu-rates-by-state","infant-mortality-rate-by-state","labor-force-participation-rate-by-state","maternal-mortality-rate-by-state","murder-rate-by-state","obesity-rate-by-state","smoking-rates-by-state","state-tax-rates","suicide-rates-by-state","teen-pregnancy-rates-by-state","unemployment-rate-by-state","us-literacy-rates-by-state","vaccination-rates-by-state"]}},"lastModified":"2020-04-06T20:09:05.148Z","path":"birth-rate-by-state","name":"Birth Rate By State"},{"article":"Blue laws are laws designed to restrict certain activities on Sundays (or other specific days) for religious reasons in order to observe a day of worship or rest.

What is a red state? What is a blue state?\n\nIf a state is a red state, the voters within that state primarily vote for the Republican Party. If a state is a blue state, its residents mostly vote for the Democratic Party. The term red state is also used to describe a state that is perceived to have conservative views, while a blue state is understood to have more liberal views.\n\nThis hasnât always been the case, however. During the 1980s, Democrats were associated with the color red, while Republicans were represented by the color blue. It was during the 2000 presidential election when journalist Tim Russert used the terms âred statesâ and âblue statesâ based on the colored maps that were used during his televised coverage. Since that time, media outlets have used red for Republican and blue for Democrat as the standard color scheme for their maps.\n\nThe measurement of how strongly a United States congressional district or state leans toward the Democratic or Republican Party compared to the nation as a whole is known as the Cook Partisan Voting Index (PVI). For example, if the national average is 51% Democratic, and the Democratic candidate of a state wins 62% of a two-party share, then that state voted 11 percentage points more Democratic than the country, for D+11.\n\nHouse balance gives a better indication of a partyâs electoral strength in a state than basic party identification and provides a definitive score that shows the strength of a party in an election. House balance takes into account the number of independents in a state. For example, California receives 55 electoral votes and has a house balance of 46D and 7R (53 out of 55).\n\n\nAccording to Gallup tracking, there were 15 stable blue states in 2017. Those states are:\n\n- California\n- Connecticut\n- Delaware\n- Hawaii\n- Illinois\n- Maryland\n- Massachusetts\n- Minnesota\n- New Jersey\n- New Mexico\n- New York\n- Oregon\n- Rhode Island\n- Vermont\n- Washington\n\nThe same data show that four additional states lean toward being Democratic states. Those are:\n\n- Colorado\n- Maine\n- Michigan\n- Virginia\n\nMultiple states are split between Democrats and Republicans. Those states â the purple states, competitive states, or battleground states â include:\n\n- Arizona\n- Florida\n- Georgia\n- Indiana\n- Iowa\n- Kentucky\n- Louisiana\n- Nevada\n- New Hampshire\n- North Carolina\n- Ohio\n- Pennsylvania\n- Texas\n- West Virginia\n- Wisconsin\n","data":{"states":["California","Connecticut","Delaware","Hawaii","Illinois","Maryland","Massachusetts","Minnesota","New

American Civil War of 1861 to 1865. This term was used to describe slave states that did not secede from the Union or joint he Confederacy. The term âborder stateâ was used because free states bordered the states to the north. Four of the five border states also shared borders with Confederate states to the south.\n\nThe five border states were:\n\n- Delaware\n- Maryland\n- Kentucky\n- Missouri\n- West Virginia\n\nIn Delaware, slavery was rare leading up to the Civil War. Both houses of the General Assembly rejected secession from the Union.\n\nIn parts of Maryland, there was support for the Confederacy. However, Washington D.C. would have been surrounded if Maryland had joined the Confederacy. During the Civil War, Marylandâs state legislature wanted to stay neutral. During the war, a new constitution was drafted that made slavery illegal in the state.\n\nThe state of Kentucky passed two resolutions to stay neutral during the war. While the governor of Kentucky, Beriah Magoffin, believed that states should stick to the Constitution and not secede from the Union, he also refused to furnish troops to defeat the southern states. Neutrality was  broken and Kentucky began to back the Union.\n\nIn Missouri, the Missouri Constitutional Convention voted to stay in the Union but refused coercion of the southern states. Secession ordinances were later adopted, although the state was never entirely under Confederate control. In 1865, the state voted to abolish slavery.\n\nWest Virginia became a state during the war when it separated from the state of Virginia. After it was established, West Virginia was considered a border state.\n","data":{"states":["Delware","Maryland","Kentucky","Missouri","West Virginia"],"customMeta":{"relatedArticles":["bible-belt-states","border-states","coastal-states",{"link":"4-corners-states","title":"Four Corners States"},"east-coast-states","eastern-states","flyover-states","gulf-states","great-lakes-states","lower-48-states",{"link":"midwest-states","title":"Midwestern United States"},{"link":"mid-atlantic-states","title":"Mid-Atlantic States"},"mountain-states","new-england-states","northern-states","rust-belt-states","southeast-states","southwest-states","west-coast-states"]}},"sources":[{"name":"The Border States","link":"https://www.nps.gov/resources/story.htm%3Fid%3D205"}],"lastModified":"2020-04-06T20:09:05.148Z","path":"border-states","name":"Border States"},{"article":"Are brass knuckles legal?\r\n\r\nBrass knuckles are pieces of metal shaped to fit around the knuckles and are weapons used in hand-to-hand combat.

In fact, itâs the second leading cause of death, coming only behind heart disease. Cancer is a disease that occurs when abnormal cells divide and begin to destroy body tissue. Cancer can affect nearly any part of the body. Some cancers can also shed cells into the bloodstream and spread throughout other parts of the body. \n \nAccording to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), there were 1.658 million new cases of cancer in the United States in 2016. Nearly 600,000 people in the U.S. died as a result of cancer. When breaking this down, nearly 436 new cases were reported for every 100,000 people, while 156 out of every 100,000 people died of cancer. \n \nFemale breast cancer was the most common type of cancer when it came to new cases reported in 2016, affecting 124.2 out of every 100,000 people. Prostate cancer, lung cancer, and colon and rectum cancer were also the most prevalent types of cancers. The most deaths occurred in people that had cancer of the lung and bronchus, followed by female breast cancer, prostate cancer, and colon and rectum cancer. \n \nWhen looking at the numbers by state, the state of Kentucky had the highest rate of new cancer cases in 2016. The state had 509.7 cases per every 100,000 people â surpassing the national average of 435.6. \n \nIn second place is the state of Delaware, which also surpassed the national average with 487.2 new cases of cancer reported per 100,000 people. Pennsylvania didnât fall far behind with 482.5 new cases per 100,000 people. \n \nMultiple other states have surpassed the national average when it comes to new cancer rates based on this data.

levy assessed on the positive difference between the sale price of an asset and its original purchase price. Assets include shares of stock, a piece of land, jewelry, coin collections, or a business. \r\n\r\nCapital gains can be reduced by deducting capital losses that occur when a taxable asset is sold for less than the original purchase price, resulting in ânet capital gains.â\r\n\r\nThere are two types of capital gains tax: short-term and long-term. Short-term capital gains tax is levied on profits from the sale of an asset held for one year or less. The short-term capital gains tax rate equals the individualâs ordinary income tax rate (bracket). Long-term capital gains tax is levied on profits from the sale of an asset held for more than a year. Long-term capital gains tax rate is 0%, 15%, or 20% depending on the individualâs taxable income and filing status. Long-term capital gains tax rates are typically lower than short-term rates. \r\n\r\nIn addition to paying capital gains tax at the federal levels, a majority of U.S. states also have an additional tax rate between 2.90% and 13.30%. \r\n\r\nThe states with no additional state tax on capital gains are:\r\n\r\n-\tAlaska\r\n-\tFlorida\r\n-\tNew Hampshire\r\n-\tNevada\r\n-\tSouth Dakota\r\n-\tTennessee\r\n-\tTexas\r\n-\tWashington\r\n-\tWyoming\r\n\r\nThese are the same states that do not tax personal income on wages, although they might tax interest and dividends from investments, depending on the state. These states typically make up for their lack of overall tax income with higher sales and property taxes.  \r\n\r\nCalifornia has the highest capital gains tax rate of 13.30%. California has notoriously high taxes and with up to 39.6% in federal taxes alone, the state taxes can seem especially deep.

These fees range from state-to-state and typically range from $50-$500. Depending on the state, fees might be determined by a percentage of the sale price.

In addition to paying cash for the car or paying monthly payments, you have to worry about gas, insurance, maintenance, and repairs. Before you even drive your car off the lot, though, you often have to pay multiple fees, including sales tax. \n\nSales tax is charged on car purchases in most states in the U.S. While you may be used to paying sales ta for most of your purchases, the bill for sales tax on a vehicle can be shocking. If, for example, you pay a 10% sales tax on $20,000, thatâs an additional $2,000 you must spend â not counting doc fees and DMV fees. \n\nSome states are more lax on their minimum sales tax requirements, and a handful donât charge sales tax at all. Letâs explore the different sales tax rates for cars around the nation. \n\nAs previously mentioned, there are a few states that do not charge sales tax on cars. These states are Delaware, Montana, New Hampshire, and Oregon. \n\nThere are even fewer states that have minimum sales tax rates below 5%. Those states are North Carolina, which has a minimum tax rate of 3%, and Hawaii, which has a sales tax rate of 4.5%. \n\nThe majority of U.S. states have tax rates that fall between 5% and 10%.

There is no duty to retreat from the situation in oneâs home (or workplace or vehicle if applicable) before using force, but there may be a duty to retreat in a public place. \n\nThe United States has two additional self-defense laws. The âStand Your Groundâ Law states that there is no duty to retreat from the situation before using deadly force, and is not limited to oneâs home, place of work, or vehicle. The âDuty to Retreatâ Law states that one cannot harm another in self-defense when it is possible to retreat from a threatening situation to a place of safety. \n\nCastle doctrines can vary slightly from state-to-state, with some states narrowing your right to use deadly force against an intruder. For example, in some states, you must provide evidence that an intruder was attempting to commit a felony. In other states, it is limited to only when a person is in his or her vehicle.\n\nNorth Carolina has a broad version of the castle doctrine. It states that a person who âunlawfully and forciblyâ enters oneâs home, workplace, or car is presumed to intend violence and to harm, and therefore it is easy to establish self-defense.\n\nIllinoisâs version of the castle doctrine has more restrictions. The castle doctrine for Illinois does not include oneâs workplace or vehicle. Additionally, one is only allowed to use deadly force if an intruder is committing a felony or enters the home in a âviolent, riotous or tumultuous manner.â\n\nThe following 23 states have a castle doctrine:\n\n- Arkansas\n- California\n- Colorado\n- Connecticut\n- Delaware\n- Hawaii\n- Illinois\n- Iowa\n- Maine\n- Maryland\n- Massachusetts\n- Minnesota\n- Nebraska\n- New Jersey\n- New Mexico\n- New York\n- North Dakota\n- Ohio\n- Oregon\n- Rhode Island\n- Virginia\n- Washington\n- Wisconsin\n\n\n\nThe following 26 states have passed a âStand Your Groundâ law:\n\n- Alabama\n- Alaska\n- Arizona\n- Florida\n- Georgia\n- Idaho\n- Indiana\n- Kansas\n- Kentucky\n- Louisiana\n- Michigan\n- Mississippi\n- Missouri\n- Montana\n- Nevada\n- New Hampshire\n- North Carolina\n- Oklahoma\n- Pennsylvania\n- South Carolina\n- South Dakota\n- Tennessee\n- Texas\n- Utah\n- West Virginia\n- Wyoming\n\n\n\nThe following have a âDuty to Retreatâ law:\n\n- Vermont\n- Washington D.C.\n","lastModified":"2020-04-06T20:09:05.152Z","path":"castle-doctrine-states","name":"Castle Doctrine States"},{"article":"CBD (cannabidiol) is a non-psychoactive compound found in cannabis.

States, however, have the final say in whether or not cannabis-derived products are legal within their state lines.\n\n## Is CBD Legal in my State?\nThere are four different types of states when it comes to CBD and marijuana legality: Green, Amber, Amber-Red, and Red.\n\nThere are several states called Green States that have legalized both medicinal and recreational use of marijuana as long as you meet the minimum age requirement.

Amber-Red states can be the trickiest. For example, in North Carolina, CBD oil is legal for severe epilepsy sufferers, and can only come from a hemp plant (not marijuana). In Alabama, under Leniâs Law, only those who have a medical condition that causes seizures or those who participate in a state-sponsored clinical trial studying the effects of CBD would have access to it. You should check with your stateâs specific conditions if you live in an Amber-Red state.\n\nFinally, Red States do not allow cannabis products in any form to be purchased or consumed for any reason. The following are Red States:\n\nâ¢\tIdaho\nâ¢\tNebraska\nâ¢\tSouth Dakota\n\nSeveral states are in the process of passing marijuana legislation to legalize adult recreational use.

The cost of living is the amount of money needed to sustain a certain standard of living. The cost of living includes housing, food, taxes, and healthcare. There is a strong correlation between a stateâs cost of living and per capita personal income.\n\nThe cost of living differs between states depending on how far the dollar goes in that state. This can be seen in housing costs especially. According to 24.7 Wall St., a dollar spent on rent in Arkansas is worth $1.58 in value, while a dollar spent on rent in Hawaii is worth $0.61.  \n\nMost of the states with the lowest cost of living are in the South, while those with the highest costs of living often have some of the nationâs largest urban clusters. Generally speaking, states that have a smaller portion of residents living in cities see the dollar go further.  \n\nThe cost of living index is based on the US average of 100. Any amount below 100 means that the cost is below the nationâs average, and any amount above 100 means that the cost is higher than the nationâs average. The lower the number, the further the dollar goes for that cost. \n\nThe cheapest state in the United States is Mississippi. Mississippiâs cost of living index is 86.1 and has the lowest overall housing cost index of all 50 states of 70.1. \n\n#### 1. Mississippi\n\n\u003e **Grocery Cost Rank**: 4th  \n\u003e **Housing Cost Rank**: 1st  \n\u003e **Utilities Cost Rank**: 10th  \n\nThe cheapest state to live in in the United States is Mississippi. Overall, Mississippiâs average cost of living is about 19% lower than the national average cost of living. Mississippiâs living wage is only $48,537 and has the cheapest personal necessities anywhere in the country. Housing costs about $795 a month, and childcare in Mississippi is the cheapest in the country, costing about $2,869 a year. Food, health care, and many other necessities are among the least expensive in the nation as well.\n\n#### 2. Arkansas \n\n\u003e **Grocery Cost Rank**: 6th  \n\u003e **Housing Cost Rank**: 9th  \n\u003e **Utilities Cost Rank**: 14th  \n\nArkansas has the lowest housing costs in America with the average residents on spending about $708 a month on rent or mortgages, which is half of what many people pay, and the median home cost is $128,800. The second-cheapest cost of living in America, however, comes with the second-lowest salaries in America. Arkansasâs living wage is $49,970. Transportation, utilities, food, and other expenses are also significantly lower in Arkansas.\n\n#### 3. Oklahoma\n\n\u003e **Grocery Cost Rank**: 12th  \n\u003e **Housing Cost Rank**: 4th  \n\u003e **Utilities Cost Rank**: 20th  \n\nOklahoma has the third-lowest cost of living in America.

Oklahoma also has some of the lowest gas prices in the U.S., and even utilities and grocery costs are below average with indexes of 94.9 and 96.5. Oklahoma City has an overall cost of living 15.4% below the national average. \n\n#### 4. Missouri\n\n\u003e **Grocery Cost Rank**: 16th  \n\u003e **Housing Cost Rank**: 2nd  \n\u003e **Utilities Cost Rank**: 30th  \n\nThe fourth-least expensive state in America is Missouri. Joplin, Missouri has the lowest real estate prices in the country, where a four-bedroom home can cost just a little over $200,000. Groceries prices in Missouri are notably lower than in other parts of the country, with a dozen eggs costing only $1.32 in Joplin. Cities such as Springfield has an overall cost of living that is 14.1% lower than the national average, while Joplin is 17.7% below the national average. \n\n#### 5. New Mexico\n\n\u003e **Grocery Cost Rank**: 27th  \n\u003e **Housing Cost Rank**: 13th  \n\u003e **Utilities Cost Rank**: 4th  \n\nNew Mexico is the fifth-cheapest state in the U.S. Groceries are about the same as the national average; however, utilities and housing are significantly lower than the national average.

Median rent for a two-bedroom apartment is $915 a month and the median home value is $161,063. The cost of living is even cheaper in Detroit, where the median home value is $48,188. \n\n#### 8.

It could become confusing in determining what is considered discipline and what is considered abuse. Therefore, parents could grow weary of what form of punishment to use. To understand more about the topic, here are the laws surrounding child discipline.\n\n## Discipline or Abuse?\nCurrently, all states allow some form of punishment that isn't too harsh for children. However, that's another issue that arises: What is considered too harsh or intense? Thanks to the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (CAPTA), these guidelines all depend on the state that people reside. \n\nSpankings are one form of punishment that is considered exceptional among states. This is because they are unable to cause any bruises that will impact the child in a significant way. These are the only guidelines that are followed throughout the country.\n\nThere are other states, however, that have special laws about discipline, which range from lenient to strict:\n\n- Lenient: Parents can spank their children if there will be no physical harm to the child(ren). \n- Strict: Parents can only gently spank their child(ren) and cannot strike, kick, burn, cut, or shake them. \n\n## Other Individuals\nIn addition to having laws about disciplining children, some laws cover other people disciplining children. These laws specifically include individuals like teachers and strangers. \n\nAs it pertains to teachers, 19 states allow teachers to initiate corporal punishment on students when necessary to correct their behavior. Punishments can include mostly spankings and paddling.\n\nStrangers disciplining other people's children, on the other hand, isn't explicitly mentioned in any state. Therefore, it would be up to the parent to decide whether they want another person to discipline their child for them. These other individuals include people like a parent of their child's friend and others.\n\n## Consequences\nFor states that don't allow any form of corporal punishment, there are significant consequences for the parents to deal with if they break the law. The more extreme the kind of punishment, the more likely the charges brought against a parent will be severe.\n\nMany states will charge parents with assault or even child abuse if they have caused physical marks on their bodies. There have been many instances where this was the case. One case, for example, is that of Vikings running back Adrian Peterson, who was arrested in 2014 for punishing his son with a switch and causing bruises on his back.\n","data":{"customMeta":{"relatedArticles":["abortion-laws-by-state","blue-laws-by-state","child-discipline-laws-by-state","clothing-laws-by-state","common-law-marriage-states","filial-responsibility-laws-by-state","final-paycheck-laws-by-state","gun-laws-by-state","helmet-law-states","homeschool-laws-by-state","incest-laws-by-state","late-fee-laws-by-state","magazine-capacity-laws-by-state","marijuana-laws-by-state","mushroom-laws-by-state","pepper-spray-laws-by-state","seat-belt-laws-by-state","states-with-stand-your-ground-laws","tiny-house-laws-by-state","voter-id-laws-by-state"]}},"lastModified":"2020-04-20T13:36:55.342Z","path":"child-discipline-laws-by-state","name":"Child Discipline Laws By State"},{"article":"","data":{"customMeta":{"relatedArticles":["child-care-costs-by-state","child-discipline-laws-by-state","child-support-percentage-by-state","529-plans-by-state"]}},"lastModified":"2020-04-06T20:09:05.152Z","path":"child-support-percentage-by-state","name":"Child Support Percentage By State"},{"article":"Cigarette prices per state vary between $5.25 and $12.85 per pack. With 20 cigarettes per pack, this ranges between $.26 and $.64 per cigarette.\n\nOnly two states are outliers, with cigarette prices above $10 per pack. Illinois charges $11.50 per pack, and New York charges $12.85 per pack. While both of these states have large populations, there is no correlation between state population and how much they charge for a pack of cigarettes.\n\nThe average cost for a pack of cigarettes is across all states is $6.96 per pack or an average of $.35 per cigarette. 17 states have cigarette prices that fall above this average, and 23 states have prices that fall below this average. This means that states tend to have lower cigarette prices than higher.\n\nAccording to the [American Lung Association](https://www.lung.org/), the average smoker has 15 cigarettes a day. On average, this costs them $5.25 a day, or $1,916.25 per year. In New York, the average smoker would spend $9.60 per day, or $3,504 every year. In the states that charge only $5.25 per pack (Missouri and Virginia), the average smoker would spend $3.90 a day, or $1,423.50 per year.*\n\nGeographically, high cigarette prices tend to be concentrated in New York and the states north of it, which comprise the âNew Englandâ area, as well as the upper Midwest states of Illinois, Wisconsin, and Minnesota. Washington, Alaska, and Hawaii also have higher than average prices but are not concentrated in a geographic area.\n\nThe lowest prices are generally concentrated in the eastern states. The six lowest-priced states are Virginia, West Virginia, North Carolina, Kentucky, Tennessee, and Missouri. Louisiana and Alabama are also among the lowest prices for cigarettes. \n\nThe north Rocky Mountain States, including Idaho, Wyoming, and North Dakota also have low prices and are geographically concentrated. In general, northern states are more likely to have higher cigarette prices than southern states.\n\nCigarettes are taxed on both the federal and state levels and are subject to both state and local sales tax as well. The federal tax rate on cigarettes is $1.0066 per 20-pack of cigarettes. The average cigarette tax among states is $1.73 per 20-pack of cigarettes. Cigarette taxes range from $0.17 per pack in Missouri to $4.35 per pack in New York. Every state also has some kind of tax on non-cigarette tobacco products as well.\n\nThe federal tax rate on cigarettes has remained at $1.01 since 2009 and many people support an increase in the tax rate. One of the main reasons for the support of increased cigarette taxes is that the increase in taxes leads to a decrease in smoking rates. This is especially prevalent among teenagers. Additionally, every state that has increased its cigarette tax has enjoyed substantial increases in revenue. Lastly, national and state polls have consistently found that people are in support of tax increases for tobacco and prefer tax increases on tobacco products rather than cutting programs such as education. \n\n","data":{"states":[],"customMeta":{"columns":["state",{"header":"Price","field":"cost","format":"moneyWithCurrencyCents"},{"header":"Tax","field":"tax","format":"moneyWithCurrencyCents"}],"tileMap":{"field":"cost"},"scatterChartFields":[{"field":"cost","title":"Cost Per Pack","label":"Cost Per Pack"},{"field":"tax","title":"Taxes Per Pack","label":"Taxes Per Pack"}],"sortField":"cost","sortAsc":false,"showAllStates":true},"customData":[{"cost":5.51,"tax":0.675,"state":"Alabama"},{"cost":5.4,"tax":1.1,"state":"Kentucky"},{"cost":5.45,"tax":0.45,"state":"North Carolina"},{"cost":5.43,"tax":1.2,"state":"West Virginia"},{"cost":9.79,"tax":2,"state":"Alaska"},{"cost":5.44,"tax":1.08,"state":"Louisiana"},{"cost":5.33,"tax":0.44,"state":"North Dakota"},{"cost":8.82,"tax":2.52,"state":"Wisconsin"},{"cost":8.05,"tax":2,"state":"Arizona"},{"cost":7.37,"tax":2,"state":"Maine"},{"cost":6.03,"tax":1.6,"state":"Ohio"},{"cost":5.41,"tax":0.6,"state":"Wyoming"},{"cost":6.07,"tax":1.15,"state":"Arkansas"},{"cost":7.75,"tax":2,"state":"Maryland"},{"cost":6.29,"tax":2.03,"state":"Oklahoma"},{"cost":5.89,"tax":2.87,"state":"California"},{"cost":9.95,"tax":3.51,"state":"Massachusetts"},{"cost":5.69,"tax":1.33,"state":"Oregon"},{"cost":5.65,"tax":0.84,"state":"Colorado"},{"cost":8,"tax":2,"state":"Michigan"},{"cost":6.85,"tax":2.6,"state":"Pennsylvania"},{"cost":9.52,"tax":4.35,"state":"Connecticut"},{"cost":8.1,"tax":3.04,"state":"Minnesota"},{"cost":8.95,"tax":4.25,"state":"Rhode Island"},{"cost":6.35,"tax":2.1,"state":"Delaware"},{"cost":6.34,"tax":0.68,"state":"Mississippi"},{"cost":5.85,"tax":0.57,"state":"South Carolina"},{"cost":6.3,"tax":1.339,"state":"Florida"},{"cost":5.25,"tax":0.17,"state":"Missouri"},{"cost":6.08,"tax":1.53,"state":"South Dakota"},{"cost":6.39,"tax":0.37,"state":"Georgia"},{"cost":6.46,"tax":1.7,"state":"Montana"},{"cost":5.3,"tax":0.62,"state":"Tennessee"},{"cost":9.55,"tax":3.2,"state":"Hawaii"},{"cost":6.23,"tax":0.64,"state":"Nebraska"},{"cost":6.69,"tax":1.41,"state":"Texas"},{"cost":5.41,"tax":0.57,"state":"Idaho"},{"cost":6.15,"tax":1.8,"state":"Nevada"},{"cost":6.89,"tax":1.7,"state":"Utah"},{"cost":11.5,"tax":1.98,"state":"Illinois"},{"cost":6.64,"tax":1.78,"state":"New Hampshire"},{"cost":9.62,"tax":3.08,"state":"Vermont"},{"cost":5.97,"tax":0.995,"state":"Indiana"},{"cost":8.2,"tax":2.7,"state":"New Jersey"},{"cost":5.25,"tax":0.3,"state":"Virginia"},{"cost":6.29,"tax":1.36,"state":"Iowa"},{"cost":7.67,"tax":1.66,"state":"New Mexico"},{"cost":9.3,"tax":3.025,"state":"Washington"},{"cost":5.83,"tax":1.29,"state":"Kansas"},{"cost":12.85,"tax":4.35,"state":"New York"},{"cost":7.99,"tax":4.35,"state":"District of Columbia"}]},"sources":[{"name":"Prices Of Cigarettes By State","link":"http://fairreporters.net/health/prices-of-cigarettes-by-state/"}],"lastModified":"2020-04-06T20:09:05.152Z","path":"cigarette-prices-by-state","name":"Cigarette Prices By State"},{"article":"","data":{"customMeta":{"relatedArticles":["abortion-rates-by-state","autism-rates-by-state","birth-rate-by-state","cancer-rates-by-state","circumcision-rates-by-state","corporate-tax-rates-by-state","crime-rate-by-state","depression-rates-by-state","employment-rate-by-state","flu-rates-by-state","infant-mortality-rate-by-state","labor-force-participation-rate-by-state","maternal-mortality-rate-by-state","murder-rate-by-state","obesity-rate-by-state","smoking-rates-by-state","state-tax-rates","suicide-rates-by-state","teen-pregnancy-rates-by-state","unemployment-rate-by-state","us-literacy-rates-by-state","vaccination-rates-by-state"]}},"lastModified":"2020-04-06T20:09:05.152Z","path":"circumcision-rates-by-state","name":"Circumcision Rates By State"},{"article":"The Civil War began in the United States in 1861 and lasted until 1865. The Civil War was primarily a result of the long-standing controversy over the enslavement of black people, dividing the United States between the North (the Union) and the South (the Confederacy).\r\n\r\nThe Confederacy was 11 states total, all in the South region of the United States, while the Union was made up of free states located in the North, West, and the geographical South.\r\n\r\nThe Confederate States of America was organized in February of 1861 when seven southern slave states seceded from the country. War broke out in April 1861 when Confederate forces attacked Fort Sumter, shortly after Abraham Lincoln was inaugurated as President of the United States. \r\n\r\nAfter four years of war, the war ended on April 9, 1865, when General Robert E. Lee surrendered to General Ulysses S. Grant at the Battle of Appomattox Court House. Confederate generals followed suit with the last surrender occurring on June 23rd.

Countries, states, and cities that are closer to the equator have warmer climates. In the United States, the northern states are farther from the equator and thus have colder temperatures. \n\nAlaska is the coldest state in the U.S. Alaskaâs average temperature is 26.6Â°F and can go as low as -30Â°F during the winter months. Fairbanks and the surrounding area experiences some of the hottest and coldest temperatures in the state with highs of 90Â°F in the summer and lows around -50Â°F.\n\nNorth Dakota is the second-coldest state in the U.S. The average temperature in North Dakota is 40Â°F. In the winter, the average temperatures are around 24Â°F, perfect for winter activities such as snowmobiling, cross country skiing, ice skating, and ice hockey. The coldest month in North Dakota is January, where temperatures range from 2Â°F in the north and 17Â°F in the South. \n\nThe third-coldest state in the U.S. is Maine, where the average temperature is 41Â°F. Winters in Maine have an average low temperature of 12Â°F and abundant snowfall. The average accumulated snowfall in Maine is 10 to 80 inches, but in Caribou, the most northeastern city in the state and the U.S., there were recently 157 consecutive days with at least one inch of snow on the ground.\n\nMinnesota is the fourth-coldest state in the U.S. Located in the Upper Midwest region of the United States and touching Lake Superior to its northeast, the stateâs climate is greatly affected by its latitude and proximity to the Lake Superior. January is the coldest month in Minnesota where temperatures as low as -30Â°F can be found around the northern parts of the state. The average temperature overall in Minnesota is 41.2Â°F.\n\nWyoming is the fifth-coldest state in the United States with an average temperature of 42Â°F. The average minimum temperature in the winter range from 0Â°F to 15Â°F. Highlands and mountaintops in Wyoming can experience up to 200 inches of snowfall in the winter and lowlands typically accumulate about 50 inches of snow. Additionally, winds are typically in the 30 to 40 mph range, with gusts up to 50 to 60 mph.\n\nThe sixth-coldest state in the U.S. is Montana, with an average temperature of 42.7Â°F. During Montanaâs coldest month, January, average temperatures are around 0Â°F. The coldest temperature ever recorded in Montana was -70Â°F on January 20, 1954. The western part of Montana experiences a Pacific coastal climate with much milder winters while the eastern part of the state experiences a semi-arid continental climate with much colder winters.\n\nVermont is the seventh-coldest state in the U.S. Vermont has an average temperature of 42.9Â°F. In the winter, Vermontâs average temperature is 22Â°F with average lows of 2Â°F. Summers are generally mild in Vermont with temperatures ranging from 75Â°F to 82Â°F and nights dipping into the 50s. Annual snowfall registers between 80 inches and 100 inches. \n\nWisconsin is the eighth-coldest state in the United States, with an average temperature of 43.1Â°F. Lake Superior and Lake Michigan border parts of the state, contributing to its long, snowy, and freezing winters. The northern and western parts of Wisconsin can experience up to 160 inches of snowfall and the rest of the state can expect to receive about 40 inches in a year. \n\nNew Hampshire is the ninth-coldest state in the U.S. The average temperature in New Hampshire is 43.8Â°F. In January, the stateâs coldest month, temperatures range from -4Â°F to 15Â°F. The northern parts of New Hampshire are affected by strong arctic winds from Canada, causing more aggressive cold fronts. In the summer, temperatures are mild and range from 70Â°F to 85Â°F.  \n\nIdaho and Michigan are tied for the tenth-coldest state in the U.S., both with an average temperature of 44.4Â°F. Michiganâs proximity to the Great Lakes and location in the Midwest greatly influence its climate. Michiganâs northern parts experience night temperatures below 0Â°F in the winter and lake effect snow in the western parts, which can receive between 150 to 180 inches of snow per year. Idahoâs average lows in the winter are between -2Â°F and 22Â°F.

However, this is an inaccurate belief. While common law marriages are recognized in several states, there are not any states where a couple that lives in the same household for a specific number of years is considered common-law married.\n\nBefore we get into the specifics surrounding common-law marriage laws, letâs identify which states acknowledge these relationships. As of 2018, eight states acknowledge common law marriages through final legislation. Those states are:\n\n- Colorado\n- Iowa\n- Kansas\n- Montana\n- New Hampshire\n- South Carolina\n- Texas\n- Utah\n\nCommon law marriages are also permitted by law in Washington, D.C.\n\nThe requirements to establish a common law marriage vary by state. In Washington, D.C., for example, a marriage is legally recognized without a ceremony or marriage license if both parties are legally allowed to marry, if both wish to be married, and if the community knows the couple as husband and wife.\n\nIn the state of Texas, there are two ways that a couple can enter into a common law marriage. One way is for the couple to agree to marry, live with each other within the state, and represent to others that they are married. Couples may also file a Declaration of Informal Marriage with the County Clerk.\n\nIn some states, common law marriage is permitted only for specific purposes. For example, Iowa acknowledges common law marriage simply for the support of dependents. In New Hampshire, common law marriages are recognized just for probate purposes.\n\nSeveral states previously recognized common law marriage. While these states no longer accept new common-law marriages, marriages that previously entered before common law marriage was abolished are recognized. Those states are:\n\n- Florida\n- Georgia\n- Indiana\n- Ohio\n- Pennsylvania\n\nThirteen states have never allowed common law marriage. However, common-law marriages contracted from other states are recognized in these states.

Community property is a state-level law. \r\n \r\nIn community property jurisdictions, community property includes any income received by either spouse during the marriage, debts (acquired during the marriage), IRAs, vehicles, homes, furniture, appliances, and luxury items. Gifts and inheritances are not included. Assets acquired before marriage are not considered to be community property; however, these assets can be commuted to community property depending on the jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nGenerally, assets will be split 50/50 in a divorce court in a community property state unless a different arrangement is agreed upon. The length of a marriage does not matter in community property states, whether the marriage lasted for a few months or 20 years. A [prenuptial agreement](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/prenuptialagreement.asp) will almost always override a community property law. \r\n\r\nCommunity property law states directly contradict common law states, where property acquired by one member of a married couple during their marriage belongs solely to that person unless the property is specifically put in the names of both spouses. Dower and curtesy are abolished in all nine of the community property states, but exist in some common law states. Dower and curtesy are a surviving spouseâs right to receive a set portion of the deceased spouseâs estate. Dower refers to the portion to which a surviving wife is entitled and curtesy refers to what a husband is entitled to. \r\n\r\nThere are currently nine community property states:\r\n\r\n-\tArizona\r\n-\tCalifornia\r\n-\tIdaho\r\n-\tLouisiana\r\n-\tNevada\r\n-\tNew Mexico\r\n-\tTexas\r\n-\tWashington\r\n-\tWisconsin\r\n\r\nAlaska can be considered to be community property or common law hybrid states. Couples can sign a joint agreement to elect to treat their assets and debts as community property. Including Alaska, there are 41 common law states.\r\n\r\nRules of community property vary slightly in each of the nine states. The information presented below is not intended to be legal advice. It is best to consult a divorce attorney to receive the most accurate information on community property laws in your state.\r\n\r\n#### Arizona\r\nCommunity property is recognized in Arizona and is classified as all property acquired by either spouse during their marriage except if one spouse acquires a gift or inheritance or property acquired after a divorce, legal separation or annulment. Additionally, real and personal property owned by one spouse before the marriage and any rent, profit or increase in the value of that property is classified as separate income. \r\n\r\nProperty purchased by a married couple who lived in a non-community property state is considered by law in Arizona as quasi-community property and shall be fairly and equitably divided by the court. Dower and curtesy are abolished in Arizona.\r\n\r\n#### California\r\nCalifornia is a community property state mandating a 50/50 split upon divorce on all income received by either spouse during the marriage, all property, and all debt incurred during the marriage. In California, each physical object or asset does not need to be split equally; rather, the law requires that the net value of the assets received by each spouse must be equal (for example, one spouse might receive the house and the other might receive the family business).\r\n\r\nThere is no estate by dower or curtesy. Gifts and inheritance are considered to be separate income as long as they are not deposited into a joint account. \r\n\r\n#### Idaho\r\nCommunity property is recognized in Idaho. In Idaho, property acquired during a marriage is jointly owned by both spouses, regardless of who purchased it or whose name is on the title. Community property also includes income earned during the marriage, including stock dividends, salary, investment interest, and retirement benefits.  \r\n\r\nIdaho defines separate property as property acquired before marriage, gifts or inheritance, property one spouse bought using separate-property funds, money earned while one spouse domiciled in a separate-property state, or all property listed in a pre-/postnuptial agreement. Idaho law states that separate property must be kept separate from other assets. Both dower and curtesy have been abolished in Idaho.\r\n\r\n#### Louisiana\r\nLouisiana is a community property state. Separate property in Louisiana specifically includes inheritance and gifts, damages or other indemnity awarded to a spouse in connection with the management of his separate property, assets acquired by the spouse with separate property or with a mix of community and separate property when the value of the community property used to acquire said assets is inconsequential in comparison with the value of the separate property used.\r\n\r\nIRAs and some retirement plans are considered to be community property, while other qualified retirement plans are governed by ERISA and are treated accordingly based on the participant and the designated beneficiary. \r\n\r\n#### Nevada\r\nCommunity property is recognized by Nevada. All property acquired during the marriage is community property except when a pre-/postnuptial agreement states otherwise, when a court issues a contrary ruling, or when the property is considered to be separate property. In Nevada, neither spouse may bequeath more than one-half of the community property in his or her will; neither spouse may give away community property as a gift without consent of the other spouse, and neither spouse may sell any real estate that is community property unless both spouses sign the deed. \r\n\r\nSeparate property in Nevada is considered to be property acquired before the marriage or acquired during the marriage as an inheritance, a gift, or as an award of damages for personal injury. Community property laws apply to domestic partnerships in Nevada.\r\n\r\n#### New Mexico\r\nNew Mexico is a community property state. Assets acquired during marriage, including property, vehicles, income, stocks, and IRAs, among other assets. Debt incurred during the marriage is also community property and is of equal responsibility for both spouses. \r\n\r\nNew Mexico law defines separate property as property acquired before marriage; designated as separate property by a valid judgment or decree of any court or written agreement, such as a deed, or gifted to or inherited by a spouse. New Mexico defines separate debt as that incurred before marriage, designated by the court, incurred by one spouse gambling, or incurred by one spouse while living apart and the debt didnât contribute to the benefit of both spouses or their children. \r\n\r\n#### Texas\r\nCommunity property is recognized in Texas. All possessions acquired by a couple during their marriage is considered to be community property, with exceptions, and is subject to division in accordance with state law. All property is presumed to be community unless it is proven separate. \r\n\r\nProperty that is not considered to be community property in Texas are birth gifts, family heirlooms, inheritances, assets purchased before marriage, and personal injury awards. Dower and curtesy do not exist in Texas. \r\n\r\n#### Washington\r\nWashingtonâs marital property laws recognize the concept of community property. Community property includes all earnings of either spouse during the marriage (including capital gains, retirement benefits, earned interest, etc.), all property obtained with earnings during the marriage, and any property purchased using community funds.\r\n\r\nIn Washington, gifts to one spouse, inheritances, and assets purchased before the marriage are considered to be separate property. Separate property can lose its status if it is combined with community funds. Dower and curtesy are abolished in Washington. \r\n\r\n#### Wisconsin\r\nWisconsin is a community property state. All assets and income acquired during the marriage, including salary, stock dividends, earned interest, retirement benefits, etc., all property acquired during the marriage, and all debts incurred during the marriage are considered to be community property and is subject to a 50/50 split upon divorce. \r\n\r\nIn Wisconsin, separate property is includes anything acquired before the marriage, assets received as a gift or inheritance, or anything acquired after a legal separation.

In some states, open carry is permitted, which means that a firearm can be carried out in the open if the individual meets all requirements of the state. In other states, concealed carry is allowed. This means that a person can carry a legal weapon in their vehicle or on themselves, but it must be hidden from sight.\n\nWhile most people associated concealed carry with guns, other weapons may also be included in these laws. In the state of Florida, pepper spray canisters that are over 2 ounces can only be carried by a person with a concealed weapons permit.\n\nAll 50 states have laws in place that allow citizens to carry concealed weapons. However, some states will not issue permits or make it extremely difficult to acquire a permit. In 2018, over 17 million permits were issued throughout the nation.\n\nSince all 50 states have laws in place, we will break down the permitting policies found throughout the nation.\n\nIn some states, concealed carry is in the form of Constitutional Carry. This means that anyone that can legally carry a weapon may do so without a permit. The Constitutional Carry states are:\n\n- Alaska (residents only)\n- Arizona\n- Illinois\n- Kansas\n- Maine\n- Mississippi\n- Missouri\n- New Hampshire\n- Vermont (does not issue permits)\n- West Virginia (residents only)\n- Wyoming\n\nOther states have shall-issue laws. This means that a license is required to carry a concealed handgun. However, the permitted carrier does not have to demonstrate âgood causeâ for carrying the weapon. There are 27 shall-issue states, seven of which are shall-issue to residents only and 20 of which are shall issue to residents and non-residents. These states can be identified on the map above or in the table below. \n\nOther states have may-issue laws. This is when a permit is required, and local authorities help determine whether permits are given. These states are:\n\n- California (residents only)\n- Connecticut\n- Delaware (residents only)\n- Hawaii\n- Maryland\n- Massachusetts\n- New Jersey\n- New York\n- Rhode Island\n\nIn some states, there are no-issue laws. This means that most private citizens are not allowed to carry a concealed handgun. In California, this is the case in 12 counties. In other areas, while these laws are not technically on the books, they are in practice. The states that have these laws in practice are:\n\n- Hawaii\n- Maryland\n- Massachusetts\n- New Jersey\n- New

Comprised of mostly southern US states, the Confederate States of America was initially founded by seven states in particular. \n\nBefore the war between the Union and the Confederacy fully erupted, the only states that associated themselves with the Confederacy were South Carolina, Mississippi, Georgia, Texas, Louisiana, and Florida. Known as the Deep South to this day, these seven states sparked the initial uproar. \n\nAfter pulling away from the rest of the United States, the first shots were fired at Fort Sumter in Charleston, South Carolina, on April 12 of 1861. This was the start of the civil war between the Confederate states and the rest of the US. At this point in time, four other states had decided to join the Deep South in separating from the Union. Known as the Upper South, the four states the joined the Confederacy later on were Virginia, Tennessee, North Carolina, and Arkansas. \n\nTo reiterate, the original seven states that the [Confederacy](https://www.historynet.com/confederacy) was made up of includedâ¦ \n\n- Alabama \n- Florida\n- Georgia\n- Louisiana\n- Mississippi\n- South Carolina\n- Texas\n\nThen, the four states that joined the Confederacy after the war began were...\n\n- Arkansas\n- North Carolina\n- Tennessee\n- Virginia \n\nBefore the official start of the war, the Deep South states had already officially declared their seccession from the Union. They were very old-fashioned in how they operated systematically, and slavery was a very prominent aspect of life in the [Confederate States of America](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Confederate-States-of-America). This was primarily due to the overwhelming number of plantations that existed in the Confederacy, and the combination of African American slaves and white supremacists amplified matters to the extreme. \n\nWith an economy that flourished because of the lush agriculature, the residents in the Confederate states had all the more reason to continue purchasing and trading slaves. The Confederate States of America carried on with their white supremacist practices without a problem until Abraham Lincoln rose to power as the result of the election in 1860. \n\nThe American Civil War erupted around this time, and at that point, the United States was broken up into two parts. The Confederacy comprised states that believed in the right to enslave African Americans and continue to operate as the South had operated for years. On the other hand, the rest of the United States was known as the Union. This was the starting point of the gradual shift that the US would make from being a country of slavery to becoming a nation of equality. \n\nThe Confederate States of America operated as their own country to the point to even having their own motto. In Latin, the Confederate motto was Deo Vindice, which translates to mean Under God, our Vindicator, in English. The official anthem of the Confederacy was a song called The Bonnie Blue Flag, though the anthem of God Save the South was often misinterpreted as the Confederacyâs anthem given the songâs popularity. \n\nFor quite some time, the capital city of the Confederate States of America was Montgomery, Alabama. On May 29, 1861, the capital city was changed to Richmond, Virginia, but that only rang true until April 3, 1865. The war ended on April 9, 1865, and the US capital for all fifty states is Washington, DC.  \n\nStates that preceded the Confederacy are...\n\n- Alabama \n- Arkansas \n- Florida \n- Georgia \n- Louisiana \n- Mississippi \n- North Carolina\n- South Carolina \n- Tennessee \n- Texas \n- Virginia \n\nStates that succeeded the Confederacy areâ¦\n\n- Alabama\n- Arizona \n- Arkansas\n- Florida\n- Georgia \n- Louisiana\n- Mississippi\n- North Carolina\n- South Carolina\n- Tennessee\n- Texas \n- Virginia\n- West Virginia\n\nIn current time, the US states that are still thought to hold values of the Confederacy includeâ¦\n\n- Alabama\n- Arizona\n- Arkansas\n- Florida\n- Georgia\n- Louisiana\n- Mississippi\n- New Mexico \n- North Carolina\n- South Carolina\n- Tennessee\n- Texas\n- Virginia\n- West Virginia\n\nAt the end of the Civil War, the Confederate States of America eventually rejoined the Union. Nowadays, all fifty states are part of the United States, and there is no split between the Confederacy and the Union.\n\n## Alabama \n\n- Joined the Confederacy on...

April 17, 1861\n\nAs the civil war carried on, the fighting became far more serious than it was when the war first started. The need for more soldiers started coming to the surface. The reality of the situation was that the Confederacy was fighting for their freedom and independence from the rest of the United States. In doing so, they were forced to put up a physical fight. \n\nMany Deep South and Upper South citizens did not want to go to war. That would mean risking their lives and everything they were fighting for, so instead of strapping on ammo and adorning military outfits themselves, southern people started arming their slaves and forcing them to fight the battles in their place. \n\nThis is where the [Confederate States](https://www.history.com/topics/american-civil-war/confederate-states-of-america) began crossing the line to the point of no return. Not only were they forcing African Americans to be their personal servants, but now, the Confederate States were sending enslaved people to their probable deaths. The biggest theme of the Confederacy was the way respect was based on skin color. White people were treated ethically and respectfully, but black people were viewed as less than and worthless.  \n\nSkin tones were the source of a high amount of prejudice in the Confederate states. Racism is still a part of modern society in America. However, it is now illegal to own a person in the United States of America. Slavery is not legal like it was during the days of the Confederacy.\n","data":{"states":["Alabama","Arkansas","Florida","Georgia","Louisiana","Mississippi","South Carolina","North Carolina","Tennessee","Texas","Virginia"],"customMeta":{"relatedArticles":["most-gerrymandered-states","number-of-registered-voters-by-state","red-states","blue-states","number-of-representatives-by-state","presidents-by-state","how-many-states-did-trump-win","electoral-votes-by-state","2016-election-results-by-state","voter-turnout-by-state","confederate-states","most-democratic-states","most-conservative-states","swing-states","union-states"]}},"sources":[{"name":"Information, Summary and Articles about the Confederate States during the American Civil War","link":"https://www.historynet.com/confederacy"}],"lastModified":"2020-04-06T20:09:05.152Z","path":"confederate-states","name":"Confederate States"},{"article":"In the United States, the phrase âconstitutional carryâ means that someone can carry a handgun without a license or permit. The term was derived from the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which gives citizens the right to bear arms. There are currently 12 Constitutional Carry states in the U.S. and three states that have permitless carry for residents only.\n\nIn these states, any person that is of legal age and is not otherwise prohibited from carrying a firearm can do so without a permit. In the states of Idaho, North Dakota, and Wyoming, permitless carry is only allowed for residents. All non-residents must have a permit to carry a concealed handgun. Concealed and open carry do not require a permit for any of the states mentioned above except North Dakota and some localities in the state of Missouri.\n\nTexasâs Constitution Carry bill had entered the Texas Legislature early in 2019 as House Bill 357. The author of the bill, Rep. Jonathan Strickland, withdrew the legislation after a pro-gun activist showed up at lawmakersâ homes in order to advocate for it. The activist was seen as intimidating lawmakers, and Strickland stated that he did not want those types of tactics to influence the legislative process.\n\nIndiana does not have Constitutional Carry. Indiana passed gun reform legislation in 2019 that creates immunity from civil action when justifiable self-defense is raised; eliminates the fee for a five-year license; reduces the lifetime license fee from $175 to $125; removes the restriction on the legal carry of firearms in places of worship on school properties; and requires that law enforcement officer to check local state and federal criminal history data banks.\n\nOhio Constitutional Carry bill was voted to advance in the Ohio House on July 24, 2019, sending the bill to another committee for review. House Bill 178 would allow anyone 21 and older to carry any concealed deadly weapon unless legally barred from owning a firearm. The bill passed, unfortunately, the week before the fatal mass shooting in Dayton. Police agencies across the state also oppose the bill.\n\nMissouriâs Constitutional Carry became law on January 1, 2017. Residents who wish to purchase guns need to pass a background check, but it is relatively brief and not as extensive as the one previously used for concealed carry permits. Missouri became the 11th state to pass Constitutional Carry.\n\nOklahoma is the countryâs newest Constitutional carry state. House Bill 2597 allows residents 21 and older to carry a firearm in public without a permit and allows military personnel or veterans 18 and older to carry without a permit. The bill was approved in the state Senate on February 27, 2019, and Governor Kevin Stitt signed the bill the same day. Constitutional Carry became law in Oklahoma on November 1, 2019. \n\nSome U.S. states have a limited form of concealed carry without a permit. These states are as follows:\n\n- Illinois\n- New Mexico\n- Montana\n\nIn the state of Illinois, a permit is not required to carry a handgun that is unloaded and fully enclosed. In New Mexico, it is legal to carry a loaded, concealed weapon while traveling in a vehicle, including cars, motorcycles, bicycles, and on horseback. In Oklahoma, legal residents of states that allow concealed carry without a permit can carry a weapon without a permit in the state provided they meet all legal requirements for permitless carry in their state and have a valid photo I.D.\n\nMontana does not quite make the cut for Constitutional Carry because it authorizes people to carry without a permit in restricted non-populated areas in Montana. \n\nArkansas is another state that is close to Constitutional Carry but falls short. The law says that no permit is required to carry when a person is traveling outside of his or her home county or as long as that person is not carrying with intent to unlawfully employ as a weapon against another person.\n","data":{"states":[],"customMeta":{"columns":["state",{"header":"Legal Status","field":"constCarry","format":"checkboxes"}],"tileMap":{"field":"constCarry","customColors":{"false":{"label":"Illegal","color":"#f11866"},"true":{"label":"Legal","color":"#79c542"}}},"showAllStates":true,"relatedArticles":["best-states-for-gun-owners","concealed-carry-states","concealed-carry-reciprocity-states","constitutional-carry-states","gun-deaths-by-state","gun-deaths-per-capita-by-state","gun-laws-by-state","gun-ownership-by-state","gun-violence-by-state","guns-per-capita","magazine-capacity-laws-by-state","open-carry-states"]},"customData":[{"state":"Alabama","constCarry":false},{"state":"Alaska","constCarry":true},{"state":"Arizona","constCarry":true},{"state":"Arkansas","constCarry":true},{"state":"California","constCarry":false},{"state":"Colorado","constCarry":false},{"state":"Connecticut","constCarry":false},{"state":"Delaware","constCarry":false},{"state":"District of Columbia","constCarry":false},{"state":"Florida","constCarry":false},{"state":"Georgia","constCarry":false},{"state":"Hawaii","constCarry":false},{"state":"Idaho","constCarry":true},{"state":"Illinois","constCarry":false},{"state":"Indiana","constCarry":false},{"state":"Iowa","constCarry":false},{"state":"Kansas","constCarry":true},{"state":"Kentucky","constCarry":false},{"state":"Louisiana","constCarry":false},{"state":"Maine","constCarry":true},{"state":"Maryland","constCarry":false},{"state":"Massachusetts","constCarry":false},{"state":"Michigan","constCarry":false},{"state":"Minnesota","constCarry":false},{"state":"Mississippi","constCarry":true},{"state":"Missouri","constCarry":true},{"state":"Montana","constCarry":false},{"state":"Nebraska","constCarry":false},{"state":"Nevada","constCarry":false},{"state":"New Hampshire","constCarry":true},{"state":"New Jersey","constCarry":false},{"state":"New Mexico","constCarry":false},{"state":"New York","constCarry":false},{"state":"North Carolina","constCarry":false},{"state":"North Dakota","constCarry":true},{"state":"Ohio","constCarry":false},{"state":"Oklahoma","constCarry":true},{"state":"Oregon","constCarry":false},{"state":"Pennsylvania","constCarry":false},{"state":"Rhode Island","constCarry":false},{"state":"South Carolina","constCarry":false},{"state":"South Dakota","constCarry":false},{"state":"Tennessee","constCarry":false},{"state":"Texas","constCarry":false},{"state":"Utah","constCarry":false},{"state":"Vermont","constCarry":true},{"state":"Virginia","constCarry":false},{"state":"Washington","constCarry":false},{"state":"West Virginia","constCarry":true},{"state":"Wisconsin","constCarry":false},{"state":"Wyoming","constCarry":true}]},"sources":[{"name":"Constitutional Carry","link":"https://www.gunlaws.com/ConstitutionalCarryIndex.htm"}],"lastModified":"2020-04-06T20:09:05.152Z","path":"constitutional-carry-states","name":"Constitutional Carry States"},{"article":"The term âcontiguous statesâ refers to the 48 states that are on the North American continent and which are connected without being split by a body of water or another country.

Together, they comprise an area of over 3,100,000 square miles (roughly 8,000,000 square kilometers).

Believe it or not, almost all the states are part of the continent of North America, which is pretty lucky. Here are the continental [US states in alphabetical order](/countries/alphabetical-list-of-countries).\n\nDid you notice which state is missing from that list? The one state that is not part of the continental US is the one and only Hawaii. Sometimes, when listing the states that are not included as part of the continental US, people tend to list Alaska as well. Let's clear up the confusion there for a moment. \n\nThe state of Alaska is part of the continental United States, but it is not part of the contiguous United States. Continental refers to which states are part of the continent of North America, whereas contiguous refers to which states are part of the major land mass with borders that denote the country as a whole. Contiguous states can be thought of as continuous because they connect and they are directly located near each other. \n\nWhile not a state itself, Washington, D.C., is also part of the continental and contiguous states. \n\n## The Difference Between Continental US States and Hawaii\nMost of the time, there is no real difference between the [continental US states](https://www.thebalanceeveryday.com/contiguous-versus-continental-us-896930) and the one non-continental US, Hawaii. The separation is noticeable when it comes to certain sweepstakes or giveaways that you may enter. \n\nMany survey companies, such as the Pew Research Center, limit their reach to the continental United States only. Sometimes, this extends to being only contiguous rather than continental, just for the sake of convenience. The major reason why sweepstakes are often not inclusive of Hawaiian citizens is due to the location of Hawaii itself. In order to interview, discuss, or engage with people in Hawaii, the researchers would have to find a way to travel to Hawaii, which just is not the most practical way of handling business, given the distance between Hawaii and the rest of the United States. \n\nThis extends into situations where data is collected from certain parts of the world, which tends to be for an anthropological purpose or from a sociological standpoint. The most common example of this in action would be surveys. The spokespeople for the [Pew Research Center](https://www.pewresearch.org/2010/09/27/what-do-you-mean-by-continental-u-s/) have said that they account for people in the non-continental United States byadjusting the samples the collect. \n\nIn order to do so, the researchers take a look at the information collected by the United States Census Bureau to determine the average gender, age, race, and other defining aspects of people in terms of research surveying. This is incredibly important because it is false advertising to make claims about the United States if the entire population of the country is not taken into consideration.

The plant has a leafy stalk that produces pollen inflorescences and ears that produce kernels or seeds.\r\n\r\nCorn is widely cultivated around the world, with its total production surpassing that of wheat or rice. There are six types of corn: dent corn, flint corn, pod corn, popcorn, flour corn, and sweet corn. Dent, flint, and flour corn varieties are used to make animal feed, cornmeal, corn oil, and alcoholic beverages such as bourbon whiskey. Sweet corn, which is rich in sugar, is usually grown for human consumption. Additionally, corn is used for biofuel and ethanol production. \r\n\r\nToday, the United States is the largest corn producer in the world, with approximately 96 million acres of land reserved for corn production. While most states plant and produce corn, it is grown mostly in the Heartland region including Iowa, Illinois, eastern South Dakota, Nebraska, Ohio, northern Missouri, and western Kentucky.\r\n\r\nThe production of corn plays a major role in the US economy, as the grain can be used for food, seed, and industrial purposes. The United States also exports about 38% of the worldâs total corn exports to other countries. In 2018, the United States exported approximately $12.9 billion of corn.\r\n\r\nThe ten states that produce the most corn in the United States are:\r\n\r\n1.\tIowa\r\n2.\tIllinois\r\n3.\tNebraska\r\n4.\tMinnesota\r\n5.\tIndiana\r\n6.\tSouth Dakota\r\n7.\tKansas\r\n8.\tOhio\r\n9.\tWisconsin\r\n10.\tMissouri\r\n\r\nIowa is the largest producer of corn in the United States. While officially nicknamed âThe Hawkeye State,â Iowa is also known as âThe Corn Stateâ due to 90% of its land being devoted to agriculture. Iowa produced 2,508,800,000 bushels of corn in 2018 and produces 196 bushels of corn per acre.\r\n\r\nBelow is a table with each state's corn production (in 1,000 bushels) and corn yield per acre.\r\n","data":{"states":[],"customMeta":{"note":"* Data is for 2018","columns":["state",{"header":"Corn Production (1,000 bushels)","field":"cornProduction","format":"numberWithCommas"},{"header":"Corn Production Per Acre (bushels)","field":"cornPerAcre","format":"numberWithCommas"},"population"],"sortField":"cornProduction","showAllStates":true,"chloroMap":{"field":"cornProduction"},"relatedArticles":["beef-production-by-state","corn-production-by-state","oil-production-by-state","wine-production-by-state"]},"customData":[{"state":"Alabama","cornProduction":39000,"cornPerAcre":156},{"state":"Arizona","cornProduction":3300,"cornPerAcre":220},{"state":"Arkansas","cornProduction":116745,"cornPerAcre":181},{"state":"California","cornProduction":11245,"cornPerAcre":173},{"state":"Colorado","cornProduction":156000,"cornPerAcre":130},{"state":"Delaware","cornProduction":24070,"cornPerAcre":145},{"state":"Florida","cornProduction":10205,"cornPerAcre":157},{"state":"Georgia","cornProduction":50160,"cornPerAcre":176},{"state":"Idaho","cornProduction":28755,"cornPerAcre":213},{"state":"Illinois","cornProduction":2278500,"cornPerAcre":210},{"state":"Indiana","cornProduction":982800,"cornPerAcre":189},{"state":"Iowa","cornProduction":2508800,"cornPerAcre":196},{"state":"Kansas","cornProduction":645000,"cornPerAcre":129},{"state":"Kentucky","cornProduction":215250,"cornPerAcre":175},{"state":"Louisiana","cornProduction":77850,"cornPerAcre":173},{"state":"Maryland","cornProduction":56940,"cornPerAcre":146},{"state":"Michigan","cornProduction":296820,"cornPerAcre":153},{"state":"Minnesota","cornProduction":1363180,"cornPerAcre":182},{"state":"Mississippi","cornProduction":86025,"cornPerAcre":185},{"state":"Missouri","cornProduction":466200,"cornPerAcre":140},{"state":"Montana","cornProduction":5780,"cornPerAcre":85},{"state":"Nebraska","cornProduction":1787520,"cornPerAcre":192},{"state":"New Jersey","cornProduction":8601,"cornPerAcre":141},{"state":"New Mexico","cornProduction":6545,"cornPerAcre":187},{"state":"New York","cornProduction":102555,"cornPerAcre":159},{"state":"North Carolina","cornProduction":93790,"cornPerAcre":113},{"state":"North Dakota","cornProduction":448290,"cornPerAcre":153},{"state":"Ohio","cornProduction":617100,"cornPerAcre":187},{"state":"Oklahoma","cornProduction":37520,"cornPerAcre":134},{"state":"Oregon","cornProduction":8775,"cornPerAcre":195},{"state":"Pennsylvania","cornProduction":133000,"cornPerAcre":140},{"state":"South Carolina","cornProduction":39370,"cornPerAcre":127},{"state":"South Dakota","cornProduction":777600,"cornPerAcre":160},{"state":"Tennessee","cornProduction":115920,"cornPerAcre":168},{"state":"Texas","cornProduction":189000,"cornPerAcre":108},{"state":"Utah","cornProduction":4004,"cornPerAcre":182},{"state":"Virginia","cornProduction":47450,"cornPerAcre":146},{"state":"Washington","cornProduction":18700,"cornPerAcre":220},{"state":"West Virginia","cornProduction":5016,"cornPerAcre":152},{"state":"Wisconsin","cornProduction":545240,"cornPerAcre":172},{"state":"Wyoming","cornProduction":11480,"cornPerAcre":164}]},"sources":[{"name":"Crop Production","link":"https://www.nass.usda.gov/Publications/Todays_Reports/reports/cropan19.pdf"}],"lastModified":"2020-04-06T20:09:05.152Z","path":"corn-production-by-state","name":"Corn Production By State"},{"article":"","data":{"customMeta":{"relatedArticles":["alcohol-tax-by-state","corporate-tax-rates-by-state","income-tax-by-state","sales-tax-by-state","states-that-dont-tax-pensions","states-with-lowest-taxes","taxes-on-lottery-winnings-by-state","capital-gains-tax-by-state","gas-taxes-by-state","property-taxes-by-state","state-tax-rates","states-that-tax-social-security","states-with-no-income-tax","tax-burden-by-state","car-sales-tax-by-state","highest-taxed-states","retirement-taxes-by-state","states-that-dont-tax-military-retirement","states-with-internet-sales-tax",{"link":"states-without-property-tax","title":"States With No Property Tax"},"taxes-by-state"]}},"lastModified":"2020-04-06T20:09:05.152Z","path":"corporate-tax-rates-by-state","name":"Corporate Tax Rates By State"},{"article":"","data":{"customMeta":{"relatedArticles":["sanctuary-states",{"link":"stop-and-id-states","title":"Stop and Identify States"},"cost-of-illegal-immigration-by-state"]}},"lastModified":"2020-04-06T20:09:05.152Z","path":"cost-of-illegal-immigration-by-state","name":"Cost Of Illegal Immigration By State"},{"article":"The cost of living is defined as the amount of money needed to sustain a certain standard of living by affording basic needs such as housing, food, healthcare, and more. The cost of living is often used to compare how expensive it is to live in one location compared to another and is also used as a big factor for people to determine where they want to be located in addition to cultural attractions, the job market, and other factors.\n\nThe cost of living in the United States varies significantly between states. A large determining factor for the cost of living index is housing. For reference, the median rent for a two-bedroom apartment in the United States is $1,192 per month. \n\nThe [cost of living index](https://www.thebalance.com/cost-of-living-define-calculate-compare-rank-3305737) provides you with the percentage difference in the cost of living between one location and another. The percentage difference is always compared to 100; therefore, if the cost of living index is 90, it is 10% below the location it is being compared to. In this case, when comparing the cost of living index of states, 100 represents the U.S. average. \n\nMississippi has the lowest cost of living in the U.S. with a cost of living index of 84.5. Most notably, Mississippiâs housing index is 67.1, the lowest in the country. The average home cost in Mississippi is $128,000 and the average rent for a two-bedroom apartment is $746. The living wage in Mississippi is only $46,084 for two adults and one child. \n\nArkansas has the second-lowest cost of living index in the country with an index of 86.9. Housing, transportation, and healthcare are particularly lower in Arkansas than in other parts of the country. The living wage in Arkansas is only $44,571. \n\nOklahoma has the third-lowest cost of living index of 87. Oklahoma also has significantly lower housing costs, with the average rent for a two-bedroom apartment costing about $879 per month. The living wage in Oklahoma is $46,613.\n\nMissouri has the fourth-lowest cost of living index of 87.1. Missouriâs housing index is 70.6, the second-lowest in the country, with average rent for a two-bedroom apartment at $827 and the average home value at about $159,000. The living wage in Missouri is $46,159.\n\nNew Mexico has the fifth-lowest cost of living index of 87.5. Housing is the biggest factor in the cost of living difference. The median home cost in New Mexico is $193,200 and the average rent for a two-bedroom apartment is $847. Albuquerque is more expensive; however, the rest of the state, especially in the southern parts, is much more affordable. The living wage in New Mexico is $48,050.\n\nThe state with the highest cost of living index is Hawaii, whose index is 192.9. This means that the cost of living in Hawaii is 92.9% higher than the U.S. average. Hawaiiâs housing index is 318.6, where a two-bedroom costs about $1,895 per month and the median home value is about $660,000. Groceries are also significantly more expensive in Hawaii since it is an island and most goods need to be shipped in.\n\nThe District of Columbia has the second-highest cost of living index of 158.4. The housing index in the District of Columbia is 267 with an average rent price of a two-bedroom apartment going for $2,776 per month.  The living wage in D.C. is $67,867, the highest in the country.\n\nCalifornia has the third-highest cost of living index of 151.7. Aside from Hawaii, California has the highest transportation index of 138.9, thanks to notoriously high gas prices (the highest in the country). The housing index is 227.3 with a two-bedroom apartment running at $2,495 and even higher in cities like Los Angeles and San Francisco. \n\nNew York has the fourth-highest cost of living index in the U.S. of 139.1. The housing index in New York is 204.4. A two-bedroom unit in New York City costs $3,675 on average and in New York state, a two-bedroom unit costs about $1,528. Groceries, transportation, and utilities are all above the U.S. average as well, but not by as large of a margin. The living wage in New York is $59,128.\n\nThe fifth-highest cost of living index in the U.S. is Oregon with an index of 134.2. Oregonâs housing index is 181.8 with rent for a two-bedroom costing $1,123, which is below the U.S. median but is much higher around cities such as Portland. Oregon has some of the highest gas prices in the country, with a transportation index of 138.9. The living wage in Oregon is $51,900. \n\n","data":{"states":["Mississippi","Arkansas","Oklahoma","Missouri","New

State"},{"article":"Crime is alive and well in the United States. As a nation, we have some of the highest levels of [crime](https://www.bjs.gov/ucrdata/Search/Crime/State/StateCrime.cfm) around the world. Even so, the crime rates in the United States have thankfully seen a sharp decline ever since the early and mid-1900s. \n\nThe American [government](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s) categorizes crime in two ways. A criminal act is either a violent crime or a property crime. The four criminal behaviors that fall into the category of violent crime include... \n\n- Aggravated assault \n- Robbery \n- Homicide, whether intentional or accidental \n- Rape \n\nIn 2016, the most common type of violent crime committed in the United States was classified as aggravated assault. Robbery was the next type of violent crime to take place most often, and although homicide rates have always been pretty high in America, they still only accounted for about five cases per 100,000 people. Property crime is another category of crime in America, and the specific crimes that fall into this category are... \n\n- Arson \n- Burglaries\n- Larceny \n- Motor vehicular theft and damage \n\n## Collective Crime Rates in the United States in 2016\n\nThe state with the lowest rate of violent crime is Maine, while the state that experiences the highest amount of violent crime every year is Alaska. The average crime rates in America during the year 2016 wereâ¦\n\n- Homicide, 5.3 deaths per 100,000 people \n- Robbery, 102.8 cases per 100,000 people \n- Aggravated assault, 248.5 instances per 100,000 people \n- Burglary, 468.9 cases per 100,000 people \n- Theft of property, 1,745 cases per 100,000 people \n- Motor vehicle theft, 236.9 cases for every 100,000 people \n\nIn 2017, the nation saw a 0.2% decline in crime across the country compared to the crime rates from 2016. However, this is not as good of news as it sounds like at face value. Even with this decrease in crime in mind, there were still over seventeen thousand murders in the country, which amounts to approximately 5.3 deaths per 100,000 people.  \n\nThe fact that the United States saw lower crime rates in 2017 is good news, but it also isnât that impressive when you look at the numbers. Take a look at the values below for crime that involved guns and criminal activity that resulted in [murder](https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/facts-and-research/murder-rates), if that wasnât the goal in the first place. These numbers are still quite large, and they are evident of the reality that the United States still has a long way to go before crime becomes abnormal instead of the norm.\n\n## States with the Lowest Crime Rates\nMaine has the lowest crime rate of 112.1 incidents per 100,000 people. In 2018, the total number of crimes reported in Maine dropped for the seventh straight year. Since 2009, the total number of reported crimes has fallen more than 40%. Law enforcement credits the community for working closely with them to achieve this.\n\nUtah has the second-lowest crime rate of 172 incidents per 100,000 people. Some factors that have been attributed to this are the absence of gangs, lack of âbad areas,â and a low unemployment rate, which has been found to be a big factor in the likelihood of crime. \n\nNew Hampshire has the third-lowest crime rate in the United States of 173.2 incidents per 100,000. New Hampshireâs [safest cities](https://www.safewise.com/blog/safest-cities-new-hampshire/) boast crime rates that are less than 100 incidents per 100,000 people. New Hampshire, however, does have a higher-than-average reported rape rate of 49.4 per 100,000 people. Researchers are not sure whether this reflects a culture of sexual assault or a culture of accurate reporting.\n\nVermont has the fourth-lowest crime rate in the United States with a crime rate of 200 incidents per 100,000 people. Vermontâs most concerning issue is digital security and the top violent crime is robbery. Seven out of the stateâs 10 safest cities reported a violent crime rate that was less than one incident per 1,000 people. \n\nConnecticut is the fifth-lowest crime rate in the United States with a crime rate of 207.4 incidents per 100,000 people. Previous Connecticut Governor Dannel P. Malloy stated, âConnecticut has proven to the rest of the nation that smart reforms deliver results by focusing on second chances rather than permanent punishment and stigma.â\n\n## States with the Highest Crime Rates\nAlaska has the highest crime rate in the United States of 885 crimes per 100,000 people. The stateâs rate of sexual assault is 161.9 incidents per 1000,000 people, nearly four times the national rate. The most common violent crime reported in Alaska is aggravated assault, followed by rape. Property crime, however, makes up about 79% of crime in Alaska and violent crime makes up about 21%.\n\nNew Mexico has the second-highest crime rate of 856.6 incidents per 100,000 residents, more than twice the national average. New Mexico also had one of the highest property crime rates in 2018 of 3,420 incidents per 100,000 people. Albuquerque, which is home to more than a quarter of the stateâs population, reported slight decreases in both violent and property crime. \n\nTennessee has the third-highest crime rate in the United States of 623.7 incidents per 100,000 people. Tennesseeâs property crime rate is also the ninth-highest in the country. The stateâs high crime rates are likely skewed by the very high violent crime rates in large cities like Memphis, Nashville, and Chattanooga, where it ranges from 525.5 to 1,142.5 per 100,000 people. Other cities, such as Germantown, have crime rates as low as 79 incidents per 100,000 people. \n\nArkansas has the fourth-highest crime rate of 543.6 incidents per 100,000 people. Property crime is the stateâs main safety concern, with a property crime rate far above the national average of 3,996 incidents per 100,000 people. Like other states with high crime rates, this is likely skewed due to some cities with very high crime rates, such as Little Rock and Pine Bluff.\n\nNevada has the fifth-highest crime rate of 541.1 incidents per 100,000 people. Nevadaâs most problematic crimes include robbery, motor vehicle theft, and aggravated assault. Law enforcement reports that most of the crime comes from the mass amounts of tourists that visit Las Vegas, Reno, and other cities with casinos and entertainment.

Rate By State"},{"article":"The death penalty â or capital punishment â is a government-sanctioned punishment for committing a crime. If someone is convicted and given the death penalty, that person will be executed, or put to death, as a punishment for that crime.\n\nOnly people that are convicted of committing capital crimes and offenses are eligible to receive the death penalty. Crimes that fall into this category include murder, espionage, war crimes, crimes against humanity, genocide, and treason.\n\nA person that has been convicted of a crime and sentenced to the death penalty is sent to death row. This is a part of a prison where inmates awaiting execution are housed. In most cases, a convict may sit on death row for several years during the habeas corpus and appeals processes.\n\nThe death penalty is a controversial topic. Many opponents of capital punishment feel that it is morally wrong, some think that it is influenced by racial bias, and others believe that keeping prisoners in limbo for years on Death Row has adverse effects on mental health.\n\n\u003e How many states still have the death penalty? In the United States, the death penalty is legal in 30 states. A total of 20 states â plus Washington D.C. â have abolished the death penalty. \n\nThe first state to do this was Wisconsin, which made the punishment illegal in the year 1853. Most recently, Washington, Delaware, Maryland, Connecticut, and Illinois have all abolished capital punishment.\n\nFlorida is one of 30 states that have the death penalty. The first execution in Florida was in 1827. Since 1976, after the Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty, Florida has executed 99 convicted murderers, including notorious serial killer Ted Bundy on January 24, 1989. On June 14, 2013, Governor Rick Scott signed the Timely Justice Act of 2013, which speeds up the process of capital punishment by creating tighter time frames for the sentenced to make appeals and imposes reporting requirements on case progress. As of September 10, 2019, there are 340 offenders waiting for execution. \n\nDoes California have the death penalty? Capital punishment is a legal penalty in the state of California. Between 1778 and 1972, California carried out 709 executions. In 1972, the California Supreme Court struck down the state capital punishment statute in [People vs. Anderson]( https://scocal.stanford.edu/opinion/people-v-anderson-22541), which was reinstated by voters months later. As of August 2017, there are 746 inmates on death row, but the last execution in California was in 2006. \n\nTexas has the death penalty. Texas was the first jurisdiction in the world to carry out an execution by lethal injection in 1964. From 1976 to September 25, 2019, Texas has executed 565 offenders, more than a third of the nationâs total. There are several reasons why Texas has the highest number of executions, such as the required strictness of appellate judges. Additionally, Texas relies upon court-appointed lawyers for indigent defendants, who likely do not have experience in capital defenses or appeals. \n\nColorado is also one of the 30 states that have the death penalty as a legal punishment. Capital punishment in Colorado was last reinstated by popular vote with 61% in favor. Death row is located in Colorado State Penitentiary, where three people await execution. Democrats in Colorado introduced [a bill]( http://leg.colorado.gov/sites/default/files/documents/2019A/bills/2019a_182_01.pdf) in March 2019 that would abolish capital punishment, making Colorado the 21st state to abolish the death penalty.\n","data":{"states":["Alabama","Arizona","Arkansas","California","Colorado","Florida","Georgia","Idaho","Indiana","Kansas","Kentucky","Louisiana","Mississippi","Missouri","Montana","Nebraska","Nevada","New

Some people believe that a terminally ill person should have the right to end their life if they choose without the interference of government or without religious beliefs coming into play. In some U.S. states, the government agrees with this and has implemented death with dignity laws. \n \nThere are safeguards in place that go along with these laws to prevent misuse. For example, two physicians must confirm the patientâs diagnosis and prognosis. Waiting periods are also required before the prescription will be filled. Perhaps most importantly, the decision falls on the patient, and doctors must confirm the mental competency before moving forward with administering the medication. \n \nIn the United States, states that have death with dignity laws make it legal for adults with terminal illnesses to receive prescription medication that assists in their death. This is also known as physician-assisted suicide. \n\nEven states that have legalized this form of death have several conditions that patients must meet. Physician-assisted suicide is only allowed for mentally competent adults who have been given 6 months or less to live because of a terminal illness. In other words, death must be inevitable in order for a person to receive the medication that ends the patientâs pain and suffering. \n\nThis has been a hotly debated topic across the nation. Some believe that itâs a personâs right to choose and the government shouldnât have a say in how someone ends their own life. On the flip-side, some religious leaders advocate against death with dignity laws, believing that suicide is a sin. \n\nThe majority of the states in the U.S. have made physician-assisted suicide illegal. In fact, there are just eight states plus Washington, D.C., that have passed death with dignity laws. Many of these laws have been passed only within the last couple of years. \n\nThe states that have death with dignity laws are: \n\n- California\n- Colorado\n- District of Columbia\n- Hawaii\n- Maine\n- New Jersey\n- Oregon\n- Vermont\n- Washington\n\nThe state of Oregon was the first state in the U.S. to pass death with dignity laws through the Death With Dignity Act of 1994 and 1997. The next laws werenât passed until over 10 years later, under Washingtonâs Death With Dignity Act of 2008. \n\nIn Vermont, physician-assisted suicide was legalized under the Patient Choice and Control at the End of Life Act, which was passed in 2013. In 2015, California passed the End of Life Option Act, although the laws didnât go into effect until the next year. In 2016, Colorado and the District of Columbia passed laws â the End of Life Options Act and the D.C. Death with Dignity Act, respectively. \n\nThe most recent laws were passed in 2018 and 2019. Hawaii passed its Our Care, Our Choice Act in 2018 and 2019, Maine passed its own Death with Dignity Act in 2019, and New Jersey passed the Aid in Dying for the Terminally Ill Act in 2019. \n\n","data":{"states":["California","Colorado","Hawaii","New Jersey","Oregon","Vermont","Washington"],"customMeta":{"tileMap":{},"showAllStates":true,"relatedArticles":["assisted-suicide-states","suicide-rates-by-state","right-to-die-states","death-with-dignity-states","depression-rates-by-state","mental-health-statistics-by-state"]}},"sources":[{"name":"How Death with Dignity Laws Work","link":"https://www.deathwithdignity.org/learn/access/"}],"lastModified":"2020-04-06T20:09:05.152Z","path":"death-with-dignity-states","name":"Death With Dignity States"},{"article":"Debt is when money is owed by one party (the borrower or debtor) to a second party (the lender or creditor). Debt is a deferred payment or series of payments owed in the future, which is what differentiates debt from immediate purchases. Debt can either be a useful financial tool or an overwhelming burden depending on the type of debt and how well the borrower handles making payments. \r\n\r\nDebt has terms that include interest, repayment and default provisions. \r\n\r\nInterest is the fee paid by the borrower to the lender. The interest rate is calculated as a percentage of the outstanding principal. Interest rates can be fixed or floating, where the rate changes depending on inflation, and interest rates can compound at specific intervals during repayment periods.\r\n\r\nRepayment can be done in three ways: the entire principal balance may be due at the maturity of the loan; the entire principal balance may be spread out over several payments over the term of the loan; or the loan may be partially paid out over several payments during its term, with the remaining balance due as a âballoon paymentâ at its maturity.\r\n\r\nDefault provisions are put in place by the creditor in case the debtor fails to meet the legal obligations of the loan. This can include repossession of a house, car or other possessions if the debt was secured by specific collateral. \r\n\r\nThe average American household has approximately $137,000 in debt. This debt is made up of credit cards, auto loans, student loans, and mortgages. With the increase in the cost of living and the median income at approximately $59,000, debt is becoming a growing issue for most Americans. Most people will find themselves paying off debt for decades or even the rest of their lives.\r\n\r\nIn addition to personal debts, the total debt by US states has also increased over the years and differs from state to state. States borrow money for education, defense, health care, and welfare expenses, as well as to cover budget gaps, unfunded pension commitments, and outstanding bonds. Debts have increased in the states as a result of spending habits or a decrease in income from taxes and other sources.\r\n\r\n#### States with the Most Amount of Debt\r\n\r\nNew Jersey has the highest amount of debt in the country. The stateâs total liabilities total $199.02 billion, surpassing its assets by $132.6 billion. New Jerseyâs debt ratio is 279.9%. The largest source of debt is the stateâs unfunded pension and benefits system for public employees. Because of the stateâs debt and the growing pressure to fund other priorities such as infrastructure and education, New Jersey legislators are looking toward tax increases.\r\n\r\nIllinois has the second-highest debt in the U.S. with total liabilities equaling $248.1. With total assets of $53.9 billion, Illinois has $192.4 billion in unfunded liability. In order to pay that off, every person in Illinoisâs 12.7 million population would need to pay $15,291. Like New Jersey, the biggest problem in Illinois contributing to the debt is billions of dollars for the pensions and health insurance benefits of retired government workers. \r\n\r\nMassachusetts has the third-highest debt in the United States. Massachusettsâs total liabilities are $95.47 billion and its total assets are $29.83 billion. Long-term liabilities are at 275% of total assets or $11,518 per capita. Massachusettsâs largest sources of debt are infrastructure and pensions. \r\n\r\nKentucky has the fourth-highest debt in the country with total liabilities of $54.6 billion. With total assets of $32.67 billion, Kentuckyâs debt ratio is about 139%. Estimated unfunded retirement benefits account for more than 80% of Kentuckyâs debt, or about $43.3 billion. $11.2 billion is made up of different types of bonds, only $9 billion of which is supported by state budget appropriations. Each Kentucky residents would need to pay over $12,261 per person to get rid of the state debt. \r\n\r\nCalifornia has the fifth-highest debt of any state with total liabilities coming out to $287.79 billion. Total assets come out to $250.78 billion, giving California a debt ratio of 107.9%.  Californiaâs debt and liabilities can be broken down into three categories: retirement liabilities, budgetary borrowing, and bond debt. Combining Californiaâs federal, state, and local debt, however, brings Californiaâs debt total to over $1 trillion. According to this [report](https://californiapolicycenter.org/californias-total-state-local-debt-totals-1-3-trillion/), the debt would cost each resident of California $33,000 or each taxpayer $74,000. \r\n\r\n#### States with the Lowest Amount of Debt\r\n\r\nAlaska has the lowest debt of any state in the U.S. Alaskaâs total liabilities add up to $10.75 billion and its total assets add up to $82.07 billion, giving Alaska the third-highest net position in the country of about $72 billion and a debt ratio of only 13.3%. Although Alaska does not have a state income tax, its revenue is well-supplied by taxes on oil and gas production. \r\n\r\nSouth Dakota has the second-lowest debt in the United States with total liabilities equaling $1.14 billion. South Dakotaâs total assets equal $7.46 billion, giving it the second-best debt ratio of 14.9%. South Dakota ranks second among U.S. states for fiscal health, with about anywhere between 4.76 and 6.78 times the cash needed to cover short-term obligations. \r\n\r\nNebraska ranks third as having the lowest debt in the United States. Nebraskaâs total liabilities are $2.34 billion and its total assets are $14.93 billion, giving Nebraska a debt ratio of 16.4%. Nebraska is one of the countryâs most sound economies, having the lowest net tax-supported debt of any state and has the second-highest labor force participation rate.\r\n\r\nTennessee has the fourth-lowest debt in the U.S. having $6.96 in total liabilities and $42.12 billion in total assets, resulting in a debt ratio of 16.4%. Tennessee is one of the most tax-friendly states in the country and will have no state income tax by 2021.

The goal of the political primaries is to choose the partyâs candidate for president, who must win delegates in order to receive the nomination. \r\n\r\nDelegates are either won by proportion, where the candidate receives a proportionate number of delegates to the number of votes in the stateâs primary, or by a winner-takes-all method, where the candidate with the majority of votes in a state wins all of that stateâs delegates. Some states are hybrids and some are proportional with a trigger, where the state will follow the proportional rules but allows for a winner-take-all allocation should a candidate reach a certain majority threshold. \r\n\r\n## The Democratic Party\r\nThe Democratic Party uses pledged delegate and superdelegates. There are a total of 4,750 Democratic delegates for 2020. \r\n\r\nPledged delegates are elected or chosen at the state level with the understanding that they will support a particular candidate, although their support is not binding. There are 3,979 current pledged delegates for 2020.\r\n\r\nSuperdelegates, also known as automatic delegates, are typically members of Congress, Governors, former Presidents, and other party leaders and elected officials. Unlike pledged delegates, superdelegates are not elected to this position and are not required to pledge their support to a specific presidential candidate nor are they bound by the results of their stateâs presidential caucus or primary. There are 771 Democratic superdelegates for 2020. \r\n\r\nThe 2020 Democratic presidential nominee will be selected by delegates to the [Democratic National Convention](https://www.demconvention.com/). To win the Democratic nomination, a presidential candidate must earn support from a majority of pledged delegates â a minimum of 1,991.\r\n\r\n## The Republican Party\r\nThe Republican Party uses pledged and unpledged delegates. There are a total of 2,551 Republican delegates for 2020.\r\n\r\nLike the Democratic Party, the Republican Party has pledged delegates that are elected or chosen at the state level with the understanding that they will support a particular candidate. There are 2,441 pledged Republican delegates.\r\n\r\nThe Republican Party also has unpledged delegates, who are each stateâs Republican National Committee members. Unpledged delegates must vote for the candidates that their state votes for. There are 110 unpledged Republican delegates.\r\n\r\nThe 2020 Republican presidential nominee will be selected by delegates to the [Republican National Convention](https://www.charlottein2020.com/2020-convention). In order to win the Republican nomination, a presidential candidate must earn support from a majority of delegates â a minimum of 1,276 delegates.\r\n\r\n## How Many Delegates Does Each State Have?\r\nThe number of delegates in each state depends on that stateâs population, similar to how the number of electoral votes depends on that stateâs population. \r\n\r\nGiven this, California has the highest number of delegates with 494 for the Democratic convention and 172 for the Republican convention. California is a key state for candidates because it is the most delegate-rich state in the U.S, followed by New York, with 320 Democratic and 94 Republican, and Texas, with 228 and 155 Republican.\r\n\r\nWyoming and North Dakota have the fewest number of delegates with 18 Democratic and 29 Republican each. Alaska has the next fewest delegates with 19 Democratic and 28 Republican.\r\n\r\nU.S. territories, such as American Samoa and Guam, have the least number of delegates anywhere from 11 to 13 delegates each for the primary, despite not voting in the general election. \r\n\r\nBelow is a table with each stateâs number of Democratic and Republican delegates. \r\n","lastModified":"2020-04-06T20:09:05.156Z","path":"delegate-count-by-state","name":"Delegate Count By State"},{"article":"Major depressive disorder, also just known as depression, is a mental health disorder that negatively impacts how a person thinks, feels, and acts. It can lead to a variety of emotional, mental, and physical problems and can decrease a personâs ability to function in their everyday life at home and work and doing activities once enjoyed. Depression is common and, fortunately treatable. \r\n\r\nSymptoms of depression include, but are not limited to:\r\n\r\n-\tA depressed mood or feeling of sadness\r\n-\tLoss of interest in activities\r\n-\tTrouble sleeping or sleeping too much\r\n-\tFeeling guilty or worthless\r\n-\tSignificant changes in appetite and weight (either gain or loss)\r\n-\tSlowed movements and speech\r\n-\tDifficulty thinking or concentrating\r\n-\tIncreasingly engaging in repetitive, purposeless tasks such as pacing\r\n-\tSuicidal thoughts\r\n\r\nBecause other medical conditions symptoms can mimic depression symptoms, it is important to rule out general medical causes first. Additionally, symptoms must last at least two weeks for a depression diagnosis. Depression can be confused with grief or sadness because they share similar symptoms; however, these are not medical conditions and typically come in waves.\r\n\r\n\r\n Depression can affect anyone, especially those with risk factors:\r\n\r\n-\tBiochemistry: chemical composition in the brain\r\n-\tGenetics: depression can run in families\r\n-\tPersonality: people with low self-esteem, who are pessimistic, or who are easily overwhelmed are more likely to experience depression\r\n-\tEnvironmental factors: violence, neglect, abuse, or poverty can may some people more vulnerable to depression\r\n\r\nFortunately, depression is one of the most treatable mental disorders with 80-90% of depression patients eventually responding well to treatment. Depression is typically treated with medication, psychotherapy (âtalk therapyâ), and/or electroconvulsive therapy. \r\n\r\n## Depression Prevalence in the U.S.\r\n\r\nAccording to the [National Institute of Mental Health](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/major-depression.shtml), an estimated 17.3 million adults in the United States had at least one major depressive episode in 2017 based on the most recent data from the [National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH)](https://www.samhsa.gov/data/sites/default/files/cbhsq-reports/NSDUHDetailedTabs2017/NSDUHDetailedTabs2017.htm#tab8-56A). Even more people suffer from seasonal affective disorder. \r\n\r\nAccording to the most recent data from the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db303.htm), depression in the U.S. is lower among non-Hispanic Asian adults, compared to Hispanic, non-Hispanic black, or non-Hispanic white adults. Additionally, 15.8% of adults from families living below the poverty line have depression, and the prevalence decreased among adults as family income levels increased. \r\n\r\nAbout 65% of those diagnosed with depression received treatment, with 44% receiving combine care by a health professional and medication. 15% of those with major depression received treatment from a health professional only and 6% received mediation treatment only. 35% of those who have major depression did not receive treatment. About 50% of those diagnosed with depression in the U.S. are also diagnosed with anxiety. \r\n\r\nA [study by [Quote Wizard](https://quotewizard.com/news/posts/states-with-highest-depression-rates) analyzed CDC data from 2014 to 2018 to find the prevalence of depression in all 50 states. Rankings presented are based on the five-year average in each state. \r\n\r\n## States with the Highest Depression Rates\r\n\r\n#### 1. Oregon\r\nOregon has the highest rate of depression in the United States at 25.20%. Between 2014 and 2018, Oregon saw a 9.17% increased in depression rates. Oregon overall has the worst ranking among states for mental illness and substance abuse, with higher rates of mental illness for adults and lower access to care. \r\n\r\n#### 2. West Virginia\r\nWest Virginia has the second-highest depression rate in the United States of 24.62%. From 2014 to 2018, the depression rate in West Virginia reportedly increased by 12.71%. In a rural state such as West Virginia, mental health services are not adequate and many people go untreated for long periods or may never seek treatment. Factors contributing to the high depression rate in West Virginia include a high rate of people without health insurance and a low college degree attainment rate, two factors that are believed to be linked with higher depression rates. \r\n\r\n\r\n#### 3. Maine\r\nMaineâs depression rate is the third-highest in the United States at 23.52%. The depression rate fell 3.80% between 2014 and 2018. Fortunately, unlike other states with high depression rates, Maine is ranked fifth in the country for access to mental health care, much lower than states with comparable rates. The Maine Integrated Youth Health Survey found that 25.9% of teens in grades 9-12 reported feeling depressed enough that they stopped doing some usual activities. \r\n\r\n#### 4. Arkansas\r\n\r\nArkansasâs depression rate 23.2%, the fourth-highest in the country. In 2017, 621 people died by suicide in Arkansas, making it the leading cause of violent death in the state that year. According to the [Behavioral Health Barometer for Arkansas](https://www.samhsa.gov/data/sites/default/files/2015_Arkansas_BHBarometer.pdf) from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, about 46.5% of adults diagnosed with a serious mental illness in Arkansas receive mental health treatment or counseling, leaving over half of those diagnosed without treatment. As for high school students, 40% reported feeling sad or hopeless almost every day for two or more weeks in a row (depression symptoms), compared the to 31% national average. \r\n\r\n#### 5. Kentucky\r\nKentuckyâs depression rate of 22.84% is the fifth-highest in the United States. Western Kentucky is a particularly dark spot for mental health, as it has lower educational attainment rates, lower incomes, poverty, and lower employment rates. In Western Kentucky, the suicide rates are about double the national average. Kentucky is ranked 30th for mental health care access, which is even harder to access in the rural parts of the state. \r\n\r\n\r\n## States with the Lowest Depression Rates\r\n\r\n#### 1. Hawaii\r\nHawaii has the lowest depression rate in the U.S. of 11.76%. Hawaiians are generally in good health â low tobacco use rates, low obesity rates, and lots of exercise. Hawaii ranks 18th for access to mental health care. Between 2014 and 2018, Hawaiiâs depression rate increased by 17.76%. While Hawaii has one of the lowest suicide rates in the country of 12.1 per 100,000 (41st in the country), its suicide rates for Native Hawaiians and young people are much higher. \r\n\r\n#### 2. New Jersey\r\nNew Jersey has the second-lowest depression rate in the United States of 12.98%. Additionally, the Garden State has one of the lowest suicide rates in the U.S. Between 2014 and 2018, New Jersey saw an 11.94% decrease in its depression rate, the largest decline of any state. Whatâs surprising about New Jerseyâs low depression rate is that it ranks 32nd for access to mental health care. \r\n\r\n#### 3. California\r\nCaliforniaâs depression rate of 14.48% is the third-lowest in the country. The state also has one of the lowest suicide rates of 10.5 per 100,000. Despite having one of the lowest depression rates in the country, Californiaâs mental health care access rank is 26th, in the middle of the pack. Like New Jersey, this disparity between a low depression rate and access to mental health care services goes against the correlation of how access to mental health care impacts the increase or decrease of depression rates. About two-thirds of adults with a mental illness and two-thirds of adolescents with major depression do not receive treatment in California. \r\n\r\n#### 4. New York\r\nNew York has the fourth-highest depression rate in the United States of 14.88%, just above California. Between 2014 and 2018, New Yorkâs depression rate decreased by 5.03%. Additionally, New Yorkâs suicide rate is 8.1 per 100,000, the lowest in the nation. Depression tends to be more common in New York City due to a high-stress lifestyle, expensive cost of living, and a lack of sleep â as New York City is known as the âcity that never sleeps.â\r\n\r\n#### 5. Texas\r\nTexas has the fifth-lowest rate of depression of 15.28%. Texas also reportedly has the lowest depression rate among millennials in the country. Despite such impressive rates, Texas ranks last for access to mental health care. Additionally, suicide rates Texas are three times higher for white Texans than they are for black and Hispanic Texans and much higher for males than for females. \r\n\r\n\r\nDepression is one of the most treatable mental illnesses. Every state has hotlines and resources available to those who are seeking help for depression. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) hotline number is 1-800-663-4357. The SAMHSA hotline is available 24/7, 365 days a year and is available in both English and Spanish. \r\n","data":{"customMeta":{"relatedArticles":["abortion-rates-by-state","autism-rates-by-state","birth-rate-by-state","cancer-rates-by-state","circumcision-rates-by-state","corporate-tax-rates-by-state","crime-rate-by-state","depression-rates-by-state","employment-rate-by-state","flu-rates-by-state","infant-mortality-rate-by-state","labor-force-participation-rate-by-state","maternal-mortality-rate-by-state","murder-rate-by-state","obesity-rate-by-state","smoking-rates-by-state","state-tax-rates","suicide-rates-by-state","teen-pregnancy-rates-by-state","unemployment-rate-by-state","us-literacy-rates-by-state","vaccination-rates-by-state"]}},"lastModified":"2020-04-06T20:09:05.156Z","path":"depression-rates-by-state","name":"Depression Rates By State"},{"article":"","data":{"states":[],"customMeta":{"columns":["state",{"header":"Against Women","field":"percWomen","format":"percAlt"},{"header":"Against Men","field":"percMen","format":"percAlt"},"population"],"sortField":"state","sortAsc":true,"showAllStates":true,"tileMap":{"field":"percWomen"}},"customData":[{"percWomen":31,"percMen":26.9,"state":"Alabama"},{"percWomen":50,"percMen":null,"state":"Alaska"},{"percWomen":36.5,"percMen":27.1,"state":"Arizona"},{"percWomen":33.7,"percMen":35.6,"state":"Arkansas"},{"percWomen":32.9,"percMen":27.3,"state":"California"},{"percWomen":32.7,"percMen":28.6,"state":"Colorado"},{"percWomen":32.9,"percMen":33.9,"state":"Connecticut"},{"percWomen":34.9,"percMen":36.7,"state":"Delaware"},{"percWomen":0,"percMen":24.4,"state":"District of Columbia"},{"percWomen":34.2,"percMen":24.6,"state":"Florida"},{"percWomen":35.1,"percMen":39.9,"state":"Georgia"},{"percWomen":35.7,"percMen":21.8,"state":"Hawaii"},{"percWomen":29.3,"percMen":33.3,"state":"Idaho"},{"percWomen":37.7,"percMen":25.7,"state":"Illinois"},{"percWomen":40.4,"percMen":26.8,"state":"Indiana"},{"percWomen":19.6,"percMen":31.3,"state":"Iowa"},{"percWomen":29,"percMen":23,"state":"Kansas"},{"percWomen":37.5,"percMen":31,"state":"Kentucky"},{"percWomen":33.4,"percMen":28.4,"state":"Louisiana"},{"percWomen":36.6,"percMen":26.7,"state":"Maine"},{"percWomen":42.1,"percMen":27.2,"state":"Maryland"},{"percWomen":31.7,"percMen":19.2,"state":"Massachusetts"},{"percWomen":23,"percMen":41.8,"state":"Michigan"},{"percWomen":33.7,"percMen":23.5,"state":"Minnesota"},{"percWomen":40.1,"percMen":25.8,"state":"Mississippi"},{"percWomen":36.1,"percMen":40.4,"state":"Missouri"},{"percWomen":39.2,"percMen":32.6,"state":"Montana"},{"percWomen":38.5,"percMen":26.1,"state":"Nebraska"},{"percWomen":48.1,"percMen":30.9,"state":"Nevada"},{"percWomen":40.4,"percMen":37.8,"state":"New Hampshire"},{"percWomen":26.2,"percMen":29.3,"state":"New Jersey"},{"percWomen":34.4,"percMen":29.1,"state":"New Mexico"},{"percWomen":32.3,"percMen":33.5,"state":"New York"},{"percWomen":43.9,"percMen":19.3,"state":"North Carolina"},{"percWomen":25.3,"percMen":26.1,"state":"North Dakota"},{"percWomen":35.6,"percMen":30,"state":"Ohio"},{"percWomen":49.1,"percMen":40.7,"state":"Oklahoma"},{"percWomen":37.3,"percMen":33.6,"state":"Oregon"},{"percWomen":29.9,"percMen":19.3,"state":"Pennsylvania"},{"percWomen":29.9,"percMen":19.3,"state":"Rhode Island"},{"percWomen":41.5,"percMen":17.4,"state":"South Carolina"},{"percWomen":33.7,"percMen":30.2,"state":"South Dakota"},{"percWomen":40,"percMen":32.5,"state":"Tennessee"},{"percWomen":34.5,"percMen":35.1,"state":"Texas"},{"percWomen":36.9,"percMen":19.6,"state":"Utah"},{"percWomen":33.6,"percMen":null,"state":"Vermont"},{"percWomen":31.3,"percMen":22.1,"state":"Virginia"},{"percWomen":42.6,"percMen":28.3,"state":"Washington"},{"percWomen":33.6,"percMen":41.2,"state":"West Virginia"},{"percWomen":32.4,"percMen":23,"state":"Wisconsin"},{"percWomen":35.8,"percMen":35.8,"state":"Wyoming"}]},"sources":[{"name":"State-by-State Statistics on Domestic Violence","link":"https://ncadv.org/state-by-state"}],"lastModified":"2020-04-20T13:36:55.342Z","path":"domestic-violence-by-state","name":"Domestic Violence By State"},{"article":"Balance of payments is the amount of revenue paid to the federal government from a stateâs residents and economy (taxes) minus the amount of federal spending in that state. Donor states are states that pay more to the federal government in taxes than they receive back in funding.\n\nThere are currently 10 US states that are considered donor states. The main reason that these states see a negative balance is because they have some of the highest household incomes in the country, paying more to federal taxes. This, however, does not guarantee that they would receive more federal funding for things such as Medicaid and education.\n\nConnecticut is the state with the largest negative balance of payments. This means that the gap between what Connecticut pays in taxes and what they receive from the federal government is large, and they receive much less than what they paid. Connecticutâs negative balance is $4,000 per capita and residents are only receiving 74 cents in return for every dollar sent to the federal government.\n\nFollowing Connecticut is New Jersey, New York, and Massachusetts, all with negative balance of payments in the thousands. Each state is also seeing small returns on their dollar, with New Jersey at 82 cents, New York at 86 cents, and Massachusetts at 83 cents.\n\nVirginia is at the opposite end of the spectrum, with the highest positive balance of payments. Virginiaâs balance of payments is $10,301, and residents receive $1.97 for every dollar sent to the federal government.\n\nCalifornia, known for having high taxes, is not currently a donor state, but the positive balance of payments is only $12. Therefore, taxpayers in California are receiving an average of $12 more from the federal government than they pay in taxes to it.\n\nThe ten donor states with the largest negative balance of payments per capita (the biggest givers) are:\n\n- Connecticut (- $4,000)\n- New Jersey (- $2,368)\n- Massachusetts (- $2,343)\n- New York (- $1,792)\n- North Dakota (- $720)\n- Illinois (- $364)\n- New Hampshire (- $234)\n- Washington (- $184)\n- Nebraska (- $164)\n- Colorado (- $95)\n\nThe ten states with the largest positive balance of payments per capita (the biggest takers) are:\n\n- Virginia ($10,301)\n- Kentucky ($9,145)\n- New Mexico ($8,692)\n- West Virginia ($7,283)\n- Alaska ($7,048)\n- Mississippi ($6,880)\n- Alabama ($6,694)\n- Maryland ($6,035)\n- Maine ($5,572)\n- Hawaii ($5,270)\n","sources":[{"name":"Donor States","link":"https://www.enotrans.org/article/new-data-shows-eight-states-were-highway-donor-states-in-fy-2016/"}],"lastModified":"2020-04-20T13:36:55.342Z","path":"donor-states","name":"Donor States"},{"article":"In 1984, the Federal Government passed the National Minimum Drinking Age Act and established twenty-one as the national minimum legal drinking age (âMLDAâ) age.  It was phased in over a few years and today all fifty states require one to be twenty-one or older to purchase alcohol.  So, then why discuss the drinking age by state?\n\n## What Makes a Drink âAlcoholic?â\nTo be considered an alcoholic beverage, the federal government has established that:\n\nAny drink with over 0.05% alcohol is an alcoholic beverage.\n\nThat is not very much, and it does create some problems.   For example, this level of alcohol can be left after cooking with wine, beer, or liquor and serving these dishes to individuals under twenty-one is technically illegal.\n\nWell, the twenty-first amendment to the Constitution makes it clear that the states determine the laws regarding the sale and distribution of alcohol and the states can delegate responsibilities to local jurisdictions.  The states, not Washington D.C., have the power to set the age as they see fit within their own borders.  \n\nBut there are consequences if a state does not comply with the federal minimum age law; they risk losing federal funds (mostly for highway projects).  So, not surprisingly, all fifty states did what was needed to comply and preserve their federal money.  But there are exceptions on who can buy, possess, serve, or even consume alcohol in many states.\n\nState exceptions to the national MLDA usually involve the following:\n\n- Religious activities\n- Educational purposes\n- Lawful employment\n- Parental, guardian, or spousal consent\n- Law enforcement purposes\n- Medical reasons\n\nThese exceptions have resulted in a complex set of laws where local jurisdictions, states, and federal regulations determine who can distribute, buy, possess, and consume alcohol in a particular state.  \n\nFor example, in thirty states you can tend bar if you are eighteen, in four states at nineteen, in one state at twenty, and in fifteen states at twenty-one.  But you may need a license to pour drinks depending on the state.  And the minimum age for the servers bringing the drinks to the table may be different than for those behind the bar.  Plus, in North Carolina, you can pour beer and wine at eighteen, but not liquor until you are twenty-one.  As you can see, it quickly gets confusing when it comes to the minimum legal age and liquor. \n\nThere are only five states with no exceptions to the federal law: Alabama, Arkansas, Idaho, New Hampshire, and West Virginia.  So, there are forty-five states that do have exceptions and these exemptions vary widely and are worth further discussion.\n\n## Religious Activities\nIn some religions, it is common to serve small amounts of wine to parishioners as part of a service or ceremony.  It would be illegal for anyone under twenty-one to take part in these activities, but some states have exceptions to allow worshipers under twenty-one to legally take part in the rituals.\n\n## Educational Settings\nCulinary schools are the most common reason for this type of exemption.  When cooking with liquor, wine, or beer it is possible to leave enough alcohol in a finished dish to be considered alcoholic.  So, if you were in cooking school and under twenty-one, and many enrolled students are, then you are not legally allowed to try the dishes using alcohol that you are learning to cook.  So, some states have exemptions for those in an educational setting to allow students to study, without breaking the law.\n\n## Employment\nThose under twenty-one working in the restaurant or food and beverage industry may be able to purchase alcohol for their work.  However, in most cases, they are not allowed to drink it. \n\n## Parent or Guardian Consent\nIn general, a \"family member\" is a parent, legal guardian, or spouse. But the laws from state to state vary widely on when a family member can provide or allow consumption by someone under twenty-one.  \nMany states require that the alcohol be provided by the family member directly, while others require that the family member be present while it is consumed.  Then, other states specify that the family member must provide the alcohol and be present while it is consumed.  \n\nA state's exception to the MLDA may also be location-specific.  Some state laws only allow those underage to legally consume alcohol at the private home of a parent or guardian, while others only allow for the consumption of alcohol on licensed premises in the company of their parent, guardian, or spouse.  States like Texas allow minors to drink in places that are licensed to sell alcohol, like a restaurant or bar, if their parent is present and permits it.  \n\nBecause the laws vary widely on the parental consent exemption, you should confirm the laws in your area for what exceptions are allowed for underage consumption in the presence of a family member.\n\n## Law Enforcement\nAs part of undercover work or research, it is legal in some states for an underage individual employed in law enforcement to buy and consume alcohol.  This is an understandable attempt to allow these law enforcement efforts to function unencumbered.\n\n## Medical\nTypically, a \"medical exception\" pertains to certain products and medications containing trace amounts of alcohol. States with this medical exception may also allow underage individuals to consume alcohol when a licensed physician prescribes or administers it as part of necessary medical treatment.\n\nThere are also some laws in place to protect underage drinkers from prosecution when they are reporting or requesting medical aid for another minor.  There are currently seventeen states that have exemptions related to underage alcohol consumption when seeking medical aid for another underage individual.\n\n## Internal Possession\nIn some states, you can be charged with âInternal Possession,â which refers to alcohol inside your body. You may be charged with this as a result of a blood, urine, or breath test.  In some states, for merely âshowing signs of intoxicationâ even if you are found with no alcohol in your system and were not seen consuming it.  If your state has internal possession laws, those under twenty-one must be very careful where alcohol is concerned.\n\n## BAC under Twenty-One\nSome states are strict about underage drinking and may also have special laws to determine the blood alcohol concentration (âBACâ) at which someone under twenty-one is considered intoxicated.  If you are underage, these levels are often low or set at zero.  In general, if you are under twenty-one, it does not take much alcohol to bring your BAC to the levels set in many states.  The low levels along with some serious penalties are established to deter underage consumption.\n\n## Overview of Four Separate States\nThe MLDA laws for Florida, Wisconsin, California, and Illinois are summarized in Table 1 and additional tidbits are provided for each below.\n\n### Florida\nIt is no secret that Florida is a known party destination.  But Florida is also known for strictly enforcing the MLDA of twenty-one.  On many travel sites, you will find people stating they got carded for the first time in twenty years while visiting a theme park.  It is illegal for anyone under twenty-one to possess alcohol in this state.\n\n### Wisconsin\nWisconsin has experienced issues with underage binge drinking on college campuses.  In 2017, a state lawmaker actually tried to push a bill that would drop the drinking age to nineteen in an attempt to curb binge drinking.  That bill did not pass, but underage teens can presently drink in a bar or restaurant with a parent present in Wisconsin.\n\n### California\nCalifornia along with Oregon has the nationâs oldest MLDA twenty-one laws.  In 2016, there was an initiative to lower the drinking age to eighteen, but it did not gain much support.  However, underage drinking is allowed in the presence of a responsible adult.  It was done to help parents teach their children the importance of moderation when drinking.\n\n### Illinois\nThis state is strict and enforces the law against possession or consumption of alcohol by anyone under twenty-one.  There is an exception for an underage individual who is at home with a parent or legal guardian.  But it is not applicable in public places like bars or restaurants.  In 2017, lawmakers there considered a bill to allow underage drinking of beer and wine in restaurants or at family gatherings with parental consent, but it has yet to move forward or pass.\n","data":{"customMeta":{"relatedArticles":["alcohol-consumption-by-state","alcohol-tax-by-state","dry-states","wine-production-by-state","drinking-age-by-state"]}},"lastModified":"2020-04-06T20:09:05.156Z","path":"drinking-age-by-state","name":"Drinking Age By State"},{"article":"","data":{"customMeta":{"relatedArticles":["drivers-license-cost-by-state","driving-age-by-state","worst-drivers-by-state","car-dealer-fees-by-state","car-registration-fees-by-state","car-sales-tax-by-state","most-popular-car-by-state","truck-axle-weight-limits-by-state","speed-limits-by-state","no-fault-states"]}},"lastModified":"2020-04-06T20:09:05.156Z","path":"drivers-license-cost-by-state","name":"Drivers License Cost By State"},{"article":"States have adopted their own graduated license programs to help teens learn and adapt to safe driving. Each state establishes their own driving laws and ages can vary greatly. \r\n\r\nDriverâs licenses are issued by each state, including the District of Columbia, rather than by the federal government. Drivers are required to obtain a license in their state of residence, but all states recognize each otherâs licenses as valid forms of identification for non-resident age requirements. \r\n\r\nStates have specific ages for learnerâs permits, restricted licenses, full licenses, and rental cars. Graduated license programs have been so effective that state are considering adopting similar programs for older teens (18 to 20 year olds) who are becoming first-time drivers.\r\n\r\nOnce a teen is of age to get his/her learnerâs permit, a set number of hours of professional instruction are typically required in order to receive the permit. Some states require every driver to attend some type of driverâs education before obtaining a learnerâs permit.\r\n\r\nRestricted licenses have regulations on drivers for a period of time after they first receive their license, typically anywhere between the first six months to the first year and a half. Restricted licenses typically prohibit the driver from driving at night past a specific hour or having more than one passenger under a specific age in the car. \r\n\r\nOnce drivers reach the full license age, they are eligible for a full, unrestricted license. Some states require that the driver must have not been convicted of violating a traffic law with their restricted license in order to receive their full license.

While no state in the United States is completely dry today, dry counties within the states still exist. \n\nPrior to the 1920 prohibition, the United States passed laws that allowed a county or township the option to be dry. Maine was the first state to implement a statewide law prohibiting the production and sale of alcohol in 1851. Delaware, Ohio, Illinois, Rhode Island, Minnesota, Massachusetts followed by passing their own prohibition laws, and by 1913, nine states had statewide prohibition and 31 others had local option laws. \n\nOn December 19, 1917, congress approved a legislation to prohibit the manufacture, sale, transportation, and importation of alcoholic beverages. Mississippi was the first to ratify the amendment in 1918, and Nebraska was the 36th state to do so, giving the amendment the three-fourths majority from the states needed to pass it. Nationwide prohibition went into effect on January 17, 1920.\n\nAfter the 21st Amendment passed to repeal the nationwide prohibition, it still allowed for prohibition under state or local laws. Today, counties that allow alcohol are considered to be âwet,â those that prohibit the sale of alcohol are âdry,â and those that have special circumstances or are mixed are âmoist.â There are 33 states that have laws in place to allow localities to prohibit the sale, consumption and possession of alcohol. Many of these are in the South, and religious beliefs are often the motivation for continuing prohibition laws.\n\nSome of the 33 states that permit localities to go dry have specific statewide circumstances. Arkansas has 34 dry counties out of its 75, and all alcohol sales are prohibited on Sundays. New Mexico is wet by default but is dry on Sundays until noon.

It is convened every four years for the sole purpose of electing the president and vice president of the United States.\n\nThe United States is a democratic republic, meaning that in general, each state elects or appoints officials that represent the stateâs residents at the federal level.  This form of governance is also used to elect presidents, through the use of an electoral college where each state is allocated electoral votes that are cast by electors who represent the state.\n\n## Determining a Presidential Winner\n\n### It Takes 270 Votes:\n\nThe current electoral college is made up of five hundred and thirty-eight electors and to win the upcoming 2020 election a presidential candidate must receive a majority of the available electoral votes.  Therefore, a contender must receive a minimum of two hundred and seventy votes to win.  \n\n### Fail Safes:\nNote that with the current electoral college, it is possible to tie at two hundred and sixty-nine votes apiece if only two candidates run, or for the candidate with the plurality of electoral votes to get less than two hundred and seventy votes if the votes are split between more than two candidates. \n\nIn the event no candidate gets a majority of the available electoral votes, the election for President is then decided in the House of Representatives.  Each state delegation is allowed one vote and a majority of states (twenty-six) is needed to win the presidency. \n\nSenators elect the Vice-President if the electoral college fails to pick a winner, with each Senator having one vote. A majority of Senators (fifty-one) is needed to win the vice presidency.  \n\n(Note: State House delegations can cast their vote for President from among the three candidates with the most electoral votes, while Senators are limited to the top two candidates in their vote for Vice-President.)Â Â \n\nHistory has shown instances where the electoral college failed to determine a winner.  An electoral tie between Thomas Jefferson and Aaron Burr was decided by the House of Representatives in 1800.  In 1824, the house decided a four-way race in which the candidate who won the plurality of electoral votes, Andrew Jackson, lost to John Quincy Adams.  In 1876, the House of Representatives resolved the complicated and still debated Hayes versus Tilden election.\n\n## Allocation of State Electoral Votes  \nAs defined by the U.S. Constitution, each state is assigned a number of electoral votes as follows:\n\n- One electoral vote for each member in the house of representatives (the number of representatives assigned to each state is determined by the national census, which is taken every ten years.), plus,\n- One electoral vote for each senator.  (Each state is assigned two senators)\n\nBased on this system of assigning electoral ballots, the allocation of electoral votes for the upcoming 2020 election can be seen in the table below.\n\nThis system ensures that every state will have at least three electoral votes, and currently, California has the most electoral ballots at fifty-five.  Also, the twenty-third amendment to the Constitution entitled Washington, D.C. to cast electoral votes in a number equal to the least populous state in order to allow the districtâs residents to participate in Presidential elections.\n\n## Choosing Electors\nSo, each state and D.C. are allocated a specific number of electoral votes, but they are then free to determine how they choose their electors to represent them in the electoral college.  Currently, all but two states assign all of their electoral votes to electors designated by the presidential candidate that wins the statewide election.  In some states, the electorâs names even appear alongside the Presidential candidate on the ballot.  (Maine and Nebraska divide their electoral votes by assigning an electoral vote to the winner in each congressional district and the remaining two electoral votes go to the candidate who wins the statewide vote.)\n\n## Further Analysis\nAn analysis of the electoral collegeâs five hundred and thirty-eight ballots reveals three groups or tiers of states based on the number of electoral votes allocated to each state:\n\n### 15 to 55 votes per state:\nThe top ten states all possess fifteen to fifty-five votes and constitute 19.6% of the fifty states plus Washington, D.C.  These top ten states control a total of two hundred and fifty-six votes or 47.6% of the available electoral votes.  (Top ten in order: California, Texas, Florida, New York, Illinois, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Georgia, Michigan, and North Carolina.)\n\n### 10 to 14 votes per state:\nThe middle group of eleven states represents 21.6% of the states plus D.C. and holds a total of one hundred and twenty-three electoral votes, which signifies 22.9% of the total electoral votes.  (Middle eleven in order: New Jersey, Virginia, Washington, Arizona, Indiana, Massachusetts, Tennessee, Maryland, Minnesota, Missouri, and Wisconsin.)\n\n### 3 to 9 votes per state:\nThe remaining twenty-nine states and District of Columbia make up 58.8% of all the states plus D.C.  They are assigned a total of one hundred and fifty-nine votes, for 29.6 % of all the available electoral votes. \n\n## Breakdown of Some Key States:\n\n### Texas\n\nTexas has added electoral votes after almost every census, and never lost one, to reach its current maximum of thirty-eight.  \n\nSince becoming a state in 1845, Texas has participated in every U.S. presidential election except two.  One during the Civil War in 1864, when the state joined the Confederacy, and the election of 1868 as the state endured Reconstruction.\n\nFor its first one hundred years as a state, Texas was a Democrat stronghold, voting democratic every time except once in 1928 (when anti-Catholic sentiment against the Democrat drove voters to the Republican candidate).  But trends towards social liberalism in the Democratic Party have flipped most of the state with the exception of along the border with Mexico and in larger cities.  Since 1980, Texas has gone Republican in every Presidential election.  Democrats are hoping to flip Texas in 2020, but many think it will be difficult challenge for the Dems.\n\n### Florida\n\nFlorida has gained at least one electoral vote in every U.S. census since 1930 to reach the current high of twenty-nine votes.  \n\nSince its admission to statehood in 1845, Florida has participated in every U.S. presidential election except once in the election of 1864, which was during the American Civil War and the state had seceded to join the Confederacy.\n\nToday, it is well known that Florida is a battleground state in Presidential elections.  But from 1932 to 1956, Florida went to the democratic nominee for President in every election.  Since 1960, the state has gone Republican ten times and Democrat five times.  Famously, Florida was the center of attention in the 2000 Presidential election when the ballots were recounted a number of times.  The 2000 election was so close, it took the Supreme Court to finalize the results.  It is expected to be close again in 2020.\n\n### Wisconsin\n\nWisconsin peaked with thirteen electoral votes in 1900.  But since then it has slowly lost thee electoral votes to reduce the count to the current ten votes.\n\nSince its admission to statehood in 1848, Wisconsin has participated in every U.S. presidential election.  \n\nIt is considered by some to be a swing state as it has gone back and forth between the democrats and republicans in presidential elections, and many were tightly contested.  However, in the last eight elections from 1988 to 2016, seven have gone to the Democratic candidate with the exception being in 2016, and this lone Republican win was considered an upset by many.  These recent trends indicate the state is leaning towards the Democrats, but only slightly.  \n\nFor the period from 1960 to 2016, the Presidential elections do show a more even distribution between the two main parties as Wisconsin voted for the Democrat candidate nine times, and six times for the Republican.  \n\nMany anticipate that Wisconsin will receive a lot of attention in the upcoming 2020 Presidential election and expectations are for the state to be hotly contested.\n\n### New York\n\nNew York peaked with forty-seven electoral votes in 1930.  But since 1950, it has consistently lost electoral votes, reducing its electoral ballots to the current count of twenty-nine.  \n\nAn original colony, New York became a state in 1788 and has participated in every U.S. presidential election except in 1788-89 when due to a deadlock in the state legislature, it failed to appoint their eight electors.\n\nSince 1960, twelve times the state has gone Democrat in the Presidential election, and three times Republican.  However, in the last eight presidential elections, it has gone Democratic in every instance. The bulk of the stateâs population is located in the major cities, where Democrats have a stronghold, so this democratic trend in Presidential elections is likely to continue through 2020.\n\n### Ohio\n\nOhio peaked at twenty-six electoral votes in 1930 and 1960 but is now trending downwards, losing electoral votes after the last five censuses.  The state lost one electoral vote in 1970, two in 1980, two in 1990, one in 2000, and two in 2010.\n\n*(Whig: 3, Democratic-Republican: 6)*\nSince becoming a state in 1803, Ohio has participated in every U.S. presidential election.  \n\nOhio is considered a bell-weather state since it has only picked the Presidential loser twice since 1896, meaning they voted for the winner 93.55% of the time in the last thirty-one elections.  That is the best predictive percentage for all fifty of the states and Washington, D.C.\n\nSince 1960, it has been fairly split down the middle, going democratic seven times, and republican eight times.  As is the case in many states, the urban areas tend to vote democratic, and the rural areas tend to vote republican.  However, there are some counties that swing in this state, mostly suburban, which may be why Ohio has proved to be more predictive of the eventual winner than other states.\n\nGiven its predictive history, the 2020 election is expected to bring Ohio into the spotlight once again and candidates are likely to focus on this state, campaigning there often.\n\n### Michigan\n\nMichigan peaked at twenty-one electoral votes in 1960.  But is now trending towards losing electoral votes after each census, shedding one in 1980, two in 1990, one in 2000, and one in 2010.\n\nSince its admission to statehood in 1837, Michigan has participated in every U.S. presidential election.\n\nMichigan is like many of the other states, the urban areas and college towns tend to vote democratic as demonstrated by the 67% of the votes cast in Wayne county (home of Detroit) and 68% in Washtenaw county (home of Ann Arbor) that went to the democratic candidate in the last election.  The rural areas tend to go republican but have far fewer people.  This results in Michigan leaning democrat but the state will swing to the republicans on occasion.  Since 1960, the state voted democrat nine times and republican six times.  \n\nIn the 2016 election, the Republican Presidential candidate won, but by only 0.23% of the vote, the narrowest margin in the stateâs history and the smallest margin of victory in any state during the 2016 election.\n\nGiven the small margin of victory in 2016, Michigan should get much attention in 2020.  To win the presidency, a candidate will have to win states like Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin.\n\n### Pennsylvania\n\nPennsylvania peaked at thirty-eight votes in 1912.  But since 1932, The Keystone State has consistently lost electoral votes after a census going from thirty-eight to the current twenty votes.\n\n*(Whig: 2, Democratic-Republican: 8, Progressive: 1)*\nOne of the original thirteen colonies, since its admission to statehood in 1787 Pennsylvania has participated in every U.S. presidential election.  \n\nPennsylvania went democratic in six straight Presidential elections from 1992 to 2012, and until recently, was considered to be part of the âblue wallâ for the democrats.  But in 2016, it broke that streak and went republican, when the Grand Old Party won with a margin of victory less than one percent of the statewide vote.  Some experts consider this an indication that voting habits may be shifting in the Keystone State.\n\nThe twenty electoral votes are an important prize for any Presidential candidate.  But Pennsylvania, like many industrial northern states, has seen its population dwindle in recent decades. Peaking at thirty-eight electoral votes during the 1910s and 1920s (second only to New York), the state has since lost forty-five percent of its electoral ballots in eighty years. It is currently expected to lose another electoral vote after the 2020 census.\n\nEven with the electoral votes it has lost, Pennsylvania will still be one of the battleground states.  For the 2020 election, Pennsylvania will be in the cross hairs of every presidential candidate.  In many scenarios, a candidate cannot win without this state and, combined with small margin of victory in the 2016 election, campaigning by both parties is expected to be aggressive in the state.\n","data":{"states":[],"customMeta":{"columns":["state",{"header":"Number of Electoral Votes","field":"electoralVotesNumber"},"population"],"sortField":"electoralVotesNumber","showAllStates":true,"chloroMap":{"field":"electoralVotesNumber"},"relatedArticles":["most-gerrymandered-states","number-of-registered-voters-by-state","red-states","blue-states","number-of-representatives-by-state","presidents-by-state","how-many-states-did-trump-win","electoral-votes-by-state","2016-election-results-by-state","voter-turnout-by-state","confederate-states","most-democratic-states","most-conservative-states","swing-states","union-states"]},"customData":[{"state":"Hawaii","electoralVotesNumber":4},{"state":"Alaska","electoralVotesNumber":3},{"state":"Arizona","electoralVotesNumber":11},{"state":"New Mexico","electoralVotesNumber":5},{"state":"Oklahoma","electoralVotesNumber":7},{"state":"Utah","electoralVotesNumber":6},{"state":"Wyoming","electoralVotesNumber":3},{"state":"Idaho","electoralVotesNumber":4},{"state":"Washington","electoralVotesNumber":12},{"state":"Montana","electoralVotesNumber":3},{"state":"South Dakota","electoralVotesNumber":3},{"state":"North Dakota","electoralVotesNumber":3},{"state":"Colorado","electoralVotesNumber":9},{"state":"Nebraska","electoralVotesNumber":5},{"state":"Nevada","electoralVotesNumber":6},{"state":"West Virginia","electoralVotesNumber":5},{"state":"Kansas","electoralVotesNumber":6},{"state":"Oregon","electoralVotesNumber":7},{"state":"Minnesota","electoralVotesNumber":10},{"state":"California","electoralVotesNumber":55},{"state":"Wisconsin","electoralVotesNumber":10},{"state":"Iowa","electoralVotesNumber":6},{"state":"Texas","electoralVotesNumber":38},{"state":"Florida","electoralVotesNumber":29},{"state":"Michigan","electoralVotesNumber":16},{"state":"Arkansas","electoralVotesNumber":6},{"state":"Missouri","electoralVotesNumber":10},{"state":"Maine","electoralVotesNumber":4},{"state":"Alabama","electoralVotesNumber":9},{"state":"Illinois","electoralVotesNumber":20},{"state":"Mississippi","electoralVotesNumber":6},{"state":"Indiana","electoralVotesNumber":11},{"state":"Louisiana","electoralVotesNumber":8},{"state":"Ohio","electoralVotesNumber":18},{"state":"Tennessee","electoralVotesNumber":11},{"state":"Kentucky","electoralVotesNumber":8},{"state":"Vermont","electoralVotesNumber":3},{"state":"Rhode Island","electoralVotesNumber":4},{"state":"North Carolina","electoralVotesNumber":15},{"state":"New York","electoralVotesNumber":29},{"state":"Virginia","electoralVotesNumber":13},{"state":"New Hampshire","electoralVotesNumber":4},{"state":"South Carolina","electoralVotesNumber":9},{"state":"Maryland","electoralVotesNumber":10},{"state":"Massachusetts","electoralVotesNumber":11},{"state":"Connecticut","electoralVotesNumber":7},{"state":"Georgia","electoralVotesNumber":16},{"state":"New Jersey","electoralVotesNumber":14},{"state":"Pennsylvania","electoralVotesNumber":20},{"state":"Delaware","electoralVotesNumber":3}]},"sources":[{"name":"United States Electoral College","link":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Electoral_College"}],"lastModified":"2020-04-06T20:09:05.156Z","path":"electoral-votes-by-state","name":"Electoral Votes By State"},{"article":"","data":{"states":[],"customMeta":{"columns":["state",{"header":"June 2017 Avg.

State"},{"article":"According to the Bureau of Labor Statisticsâ [latest employment report](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t17.htm), there are about 157 million Americans in the U.S. labor force. Most American workers, 71% of all nonfarm payroll employees, are employed in the service sector â thatâs a total of 107.8 million people employed in the private service-providing industries. The largest sectors among these are trade, transportation, and utilities, followed by education and health services, profession and business services, and leisure and hospitality. Outside of this, about 22.5 million Americans work in government and 12.9 million work in manufacturing. \r\n\r\nIn addition to the 157 million people in the American labor force, there are about 16 million people who are self-employed. Millennials are the largest generation in the U.S. labor force, comprising about 35% of the total labor force. A higher number of older Americans are working than in previous decades and a much smaller share of teenagers work today compared with earlier decades. \r\n\r\nEvery month, tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of jobs are added to the economy. Since 2010, the U.S. economy has seen job growth every month, with an average of 176,000 jobs per month in 2019 and an average of 223,000 jobs per month in 2018. \r\n\r\nThe job market in the U.S. varies greatly from state to state. Each state has its own economy and industries, and the unemployment/employment rates can be useful in determining the health of a stateâs economy.\r\n\r\n## States with the Highest Employment Rates\r\n\r\n#### 1. South Carolina\r\nSouth Carolina has the highest employment rate in the United States of 97.7% (an unemployment rate of 2.3%). From September 2019 to December 2019, South Carolinaâs unemployment rate dropped from 2.9% to 2.3%, hitting historic lows four times. Despite this, South Carolina has one of the lowest labor participation rates in the country of 58%, causing the stateâs Department of Employment and Workforce to spend the majority of its time and resources finding workers to fill vacancies. \r\n\r\n#### 2. Utah\r\nUtah is tied with South Carolina for the highest employment rate of 97.7%. Utah was also ranked first in the U.S. for its rate of adding jobs over the course of 2019, which were up 3.2% vs. the national average of 1.5%. Some of Utahâs industries that have seen the most growth are construction, education and health services, leisure and hospitality services, and natural resources.\r\n\r\n#### 3. Vermont\r\nVermont is tied with both South Carolina and Utah for the highest employment rate of 97.7%. Some business owners in the state argue that the unemployment rate is too low in Vermont, as they are lacking qualified skilled workers for their companies, specifically in the manufacturing industry. Employers are cutting back on hours and production because they are unable to find the help that they need. \r\n\r\n#### 4. North Dakota\r\nNorth Dakota has the fourth-highest employment rate in the U.S. of 97.6%, an unemployment rate of 2.4%. After the Great Recession in 2008, North Dakotaâs unemployment rate stayed relatively low compared to the rest of the country, never going above 4.3%. \r\n\r\n#### 5. Colorado\r\nColorado has the fifth-highest employment rate in the U.S. of 97.5%. Colorado has an unemployment rate of 2.5%. Like the other states with high employment rates, there are not enough available workers in Colorado for jobs that need to be filled. Some counties in Colorado, such as Yuma and Kiowa, have unemployment rates as low at 1.1%. \r\n\r\n## States with the Lowest Employment Rates\r\n\r\n#### 1. Alaska\r\nAlaska has an employment rate of 93.9%, the lowest in the United States. The stateâs unemployment rate is 6.1%. Alaska is in a statewide recession and has had the fastest rate of job losses since 2015. Alaskaâs oil and gas, construction, professional and business services, and state government sectors have all lost significant numbers of jobs over the past few years. \r\n\r\n#### 2. Mississippi\r\nMississippiâs employment rate of 94.3% makes it the second-lowest in the U.S. While Mississippiâs unemployment rate has been decreasing in recent years. It began rising again in 2019 and the state has the second-lowest labor participation rate in the U.S. of 55.9%. This means that just over half of the stateâs eligible workers are active in the economy, causing an overall lower domestic product and lower tax revenues for the state. \r\n\r\n#### 3. District of Columbia\r\nThe District of Columbia has an employment rate of 94.7%, the third-lowest in the U.S. D.C. has an unemployment rate of 5.3% and black residents in the District are six times as likely to be unemployed than their white counterparts, which drives up the unemployment rate. Black D.C. residents have an unemployment rate of about 11.3%, while white residents have an unemployment rate of about 1.9%. This is the result of years of economic disenfranchisement in the District that recent efforts to create equal opportunities do little to change. \r\n\r\n#### 4. West Virginia\r\nWest Virginia has the fourth-lowest employment rate in the nation of 95.0%. West Virginia has an unemployment rate of 5.0% and a labor participation rate of 55.7%, the lowest in the U.S. State leaders look to increasing the number of people with technical and two-year degrees to increase both employment and labor force participation. \r\n\r\n#### 5.

A death sentence is the sentence that someone is to be punished via the death penalty. Execution is the act of carrying out the death sentence. Crimes that are punishable by the death penalty are known as capital crimes, capital offenses, or capital felonies and include crimes such as murder, mass murder, aircraft hijacking, terrorism, and drug trafficking among many others.\r\n\r\nCapital punishment is controversial in many states and countries around the world. Proponents of capital punishment argue that it is an important tool to deter crime, costs less than life imprisonment, and can often help the victim or grieving families feel better. Opponents of the death penalty argue that the punishment is inhumane and biased, and does not deter crime. \r\n\r\nThe US Supreme Court has ruled that the death penalty does not violate the Eighth Amendmentâs ban on cruel and unusual punishment. \r\n\r\nThe following states have abolished the death penalty:\r\n\r\n-\tAlaska\r\n-\tConnecticut\r\n-\tDelaware\r\n-\tDistrict of Columbia\r\n-\tHawaii\r\n-\tIllinois\r\n-\tIowa\r\n-\tMaine \r\n-\tMaryland\r\n-\tMassachusetts\r\n-\tMichigan\r\n-\tMinnesota\r\n-\tNew Hampshire\r\n-\tNew Jersey\r\n-\tNew Mexico\r\n-\tNew York\r\n-\tNorth Dakota\r\n-\tRhode Island\r\n-\tVermont\r\n-\tWashington\r\n-\tWest Virginia\r\n-\tWisconsin\r\n\r\nThe rest of the US states retain the death penalty. \r\n\r\nOut of the 29 states that still retain the death penalty, eight of them had executions in 2018.

Some states saw significant increases in population numbers that contributed to this overall growth. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the top fastest-growing states during this period were Nevada and Idaho.\n\nBoth Nevada and Idaho saw their populations rise by 2.1% from July 2017 to July 2018. During this period, Nevadaâs population rose to 3.03 million, while Idaho now has 1.75 million people living within its borders.\n\nUtah didnât fall too far behind, posting growth of 1.9%, bringing its population to 3.16 million. The fourth fastest-growing state was reported to be Arizona. This stateâs population grew to 7.17 million â an increase of 1.7%.\n\nThe U.S. Census Bureau data show that the most significant population growth occurred throughout the South and West regions of the U.S. Each region recorded an increase of 0.9% during the same period. However, not all states in these regions saw growth. Some states â including Hawaii, Louisiana, and Mississippi â saw their numbers decline. In total, nine states saw a loss in population. This is primarily due to fewer births, more deaths, and no growth from domestic or international migration.\n\n## Fastest-Growing States in the U.S.\n\nNevada is the fastest-growing state in the United States. Between 2017 and 2018, Nevadaâs population increased 2.1% from 2,972,405 to 3,034,392. A majority of new residents migrated from California followed by Texas, Arizona, and other western states. Unsurprisingly, because of this, real estate rental and leasing was the fastest growing industry in the states by total economic output due to the growing demand for housing. Additionally, this has led to growing home prices with the median home value in Nevada at $258,200.  \n\nIdaho also had a population growth of 2.1%, growing from 1,718,904 to 1,754,208. People from all over the U.S. are being drawn to Idaho for its affordability and the strong job market. Additionally, Boise has a rapidly growing tech sector. Many people migrating to Idaho are from California, most likely due to its affordability (especially compared to California) and because of a much lower population density. Despite the stateâs rapid growth, it is the 12th-smallest state in the U.S.\n\nUtah is the third-fastest growing state with a percent growth of 1.9%. From 2017 to 2018, Utah grew from 3,103,118 to 3,161,105; a growth of 57,987 people. Unlike other rapidly-growing states, the high rate of births accounted for the majority of the population growth in Utah rather than people migrating from other states. About 62% of Utah residents are Mormon, who have an average of 3.4 children compared to 2.1 children among all American adults. \n\nArizona is the fourth-fastest growing state with a percent growth of 1.7%. Arizonaâs population increased by 122,770 from 7,048,876 in 2017 to 7,171,646 in 2018. Arizona is attractive because of its sunny weather, good job market, affordability, and a wide variety of entertainment options such as festivals, museums, celebrity-owned restaurants, and more. Arizona also has the Grand Canyon. \n\nFlorida is the fifth-fastest growing state in the U.S. with a growth percentage of 1.5%. Floridaâs population grew by 322,513 people from 2017 to 2018; from 20,976,812 to 21,299,325. Florida is the third-largest state by population in the United States; however, even the large net migration to the state has not been enough to raise housing values back to their pre-recession values. Florida has no state income tax; the cost of living is relatively lower than other East Coast states and has warm weather year-round.\n\n## Fastest Shrinking States in the United States\n\nWyoming is experiencing the fastest population loss of all 50 states with a population growth of -1.85%. Wyoming has the smallest population in the United States of about 579,000 people. This is attributed to employment and stronger economies in the neighboring states around Wyoming. Wyoming lost about 17,000 jobs between 2015 and 2017, with Colorado being Wyomingâs number one competitor. Things are looking up for Wyoming as the state experienced a 3.7% GDP growth from 2017 to 2018. \n\nWest Virginia is the second-fastest shrinking state with a population growth of -1.54%. This likely because of West Virginiaâs employment rate being above the national rate at 4.8% compared to 3.6%. Additionally, West Virginiaâs poverty rate is the third-highest in the country at 19.1%. West Virginia also experienced more deaths than births between 2016 and 2017 as one of the states most affected by the opioid epidemic. West Virginia has experienced a -4.11% population growth since 2010.\n\nIllinois has the third-fastest shrinking population in the U.S. with a population growth of -0.64%. Because of the population decline, the demand for housing has also declined, greatly affecting Illinoisâs largest industry: real estate, rental, and leasing. Despite this, Illinois is still the sixth-largest state by population in the United States with 12.8 million people. \n\nHawaii is the fourth-fastest shrinking state with a population growth of -0.55%. The main factor contributing to this is that Hawaii has the highest cost of living in the United States. The median home value in Hawaii is $672,429 and the average rent for a two-bedroom apartment is $1,895 per month. Groceries are also significantly more expensive in Hawaii since itâs an island and most goods need to be shipped in.\n\nNew York is the fifth-fastest shrinking state with a population growth of -0.52%. Between July 2017 and July 2018, 180,306 people left New York and 131,746 moved to New York, a net loss of 48,560 people. In 2017, about 131 people left New York City every day. This is caused by the cost of living in New York as a whole and the fast pace of New York City. Some people can no longer afford to live there and others are burned out from the hustle and bustle of the city. \n","data":{"states":["Nevada","Idaho","Utah","Arizona","Florida","Washington","Colorado","Texas","South Carolina","North Carolina"],"customMeta":{"columns":["state","growth","growthSince2010","population"],"tileMap":{"field":"Growth"},"scatterChartFields":[{"field":"Growth","title":"2020 Growth","label":"Population Growth (%)"},{"field":"growthSince2010","title":"Growth Since 2010","label":"Population Growth (%)"}],"showAllStates":true,"sortAsc":false,"sortField":"Growth"}},"sources":[{"name":"Nevada and Idaho Are the Nationâs Fastest-Growing States","link":"https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2018/estimates-national-state.html"}],"lastModified":"2020-04-06T20:09:05.156Z","path":"fastest-growing-states","name":"Fastest Growing States"},{"article":"","data":{"states":[],"customMeta":{"columns":["state",{"header":"Deaths","field":"deaths","format":"numberWithCommas"},{"header":"Fatal Crashes","field":"fatalCrashes","format":"numberWithCommas"},"population"],"sortField":"fatalCrashes","sortAsc":false,"showAllStates":true,"tileMap":{"field":"fatalCrashes"},"relatedArticles":["drivers-license-cost-by-state","driving-age-by-state","worst-drivers-by-state","car-dealer-fees-by-state","car-registration-fees-by-state","car-sales-tax-by-state","most-popular-car-by-state","truck-axle-weight-limits-by-state","speed-limits-by-state","no-fault-states"]},"customData":[{"deaths":953,"fatalCrashes":876,"state":"Alabama"},{"deaths":80,"fatalCrashes":69,"state":"Alaska"},{"deaths":1010,"fatalCrashes":916,"state":"Arizona"},{"deaths":516,"fatalCrashes":472,"state":"Arkansas"},{"deaths":3563,"fatalCrashes":3259,"state":"California"},{"deaths":632,"fatalCrashes":588,"state":"Colorado"},{"deaths":294,"fatalCrashes":276,"state":"Connecticut"},{"deaths":111,"fatalCrashes":104,"state":"Delaware"},{"deaths":31,"fatalCrashes":30,"state":"District of Columbia"},{"deaths":3133,"fatalCrashes":2915,"state":"Florida"},{"deaths":1504,"fatalCrashes":1407,"state":"Georgia"},{"deaths":117,"fatalCrashes":110,"state":"Hawaii"},{"deaths":231,"fatalCrashes":212,"state":"Idaho"},{"deaths":1031,"fatalCrashes":948,"state":"Illinois"},{"deaths":858,"fatalCrashes":774,"state":"Indiana"},{"deaths":318,"fatalCrashes":291,"state":"Iowa"},{"deaths":404,"fatalCrashes":366,"state":"Kansas"},{"deaths":724,"fatalCrashes":664,"state":"Kentucky"},{"deaths":768,"fatalCrashes":716,"state":"Louisiana"},{"deaths":137,"fatalCrashes":128,"state":"Maine"},{"deaths":501,"fatalCrashes":474,"state":"Maryland"},{"deaths":360,"fatalCrashes":343,"state":"Massachusetts"},{"deaths":974,"fatalCrashes":905,"state":"Michigan"},{"deaths":381,"fatalCrashes":349,"state":"Minnesota"},{"deaths":664,"fatalCrashes":597,"state":"Mississippi"},{"deaths":921,"fatalCrashes":848,"state":"Missouri"},{"deaths":182,"fatalCrashes":168,"state":"Montana"},{"deaths":230,"fatalCrashes":201,"state":"Nebraska"},{"deaths":330,"fatalCrashes":300,"state":"Nevada"},{"deaths":147,"fatalCrashes":134,"state":"New Hampshire"},{"deaths":564,"fatalCrashes":525,"state":"New Jersey"},{"deaths":391,"fatalCrashes":350,"state":"New Mexico"},{"deaths":943,"fatalCrashes":889,"state":"New York"},{"deaths":1437,"fatalCrashes":1321,"state":"North Carolina"},{"deaths":105,"fatalCrashes":95,"state":"North Dakota"},{"deaths":1068,"fatalCrashes":996,"state":"Ohio"},{"deaths":655,"fatalCrashes":603,"state":"Oklahoma"},{"deaths":506,"fatalCrashes":450,"state":"Oregon"},{"deaths":1190,"fatalCrashes":1103,"state":"Pennsylvania"},{"deaths":59,"fatalCrashes":56,"state":"Rhode Island"},{"deaths":1037,"fatalCrashes":970,"state":"South Carolina"},{"deaths":130,"fatalCrashes":110,"state":"South Dakota"},{"deaths":1041,"fatalCrashes":974,"state":"Tennessee"},{"deaths":3642,"fatalCrashes":3305,"state":"Texas"},{"deaths":260,"fatalCrashes":237,"state":"Utah"},{"deaths":68,"fatalCrashes":60,"state":"Vermont"},{"deaths":820,"fatalCrashes":778,"state":"Virginia"},{"deaths":546,"fatalCrashes":497,"state":"Washington"},{"deaths":294,"fatalCrashes":265,"state":"West Virginia"},{"deaths":588,"fatalCrashes":530,"state":"Wisconsin"},{"deaths":111,"fatalCrashes":100,"state":"Wyoming"}]},"sources":[{"name":"State Auto Fatalities","link":"https://www.iihs.org/topics/fatality-statistics/detail/state-by-state"}],"lastModified":"2020-04-20T13:36:55.342Z","path":"fatal-car-accidents-by-state","name":"Fatal Car Accidents By State"},{"article":"Federal aid is allocated to states for a variety of purposes. After the federal government generates revenue from taxes, it is redistributed to the states based on need. Not all states benefit equally from this redistribution.\r\n\r\nFederal aid is distributed to states for transportation, public education, Medicaid, community development, and other programs vital to residents.\r\n\r\nStates that receive more federal aid tend to have poorer populations, lower tax revenues and have more assistance programs such as Medicaid. States with higher income residents tend to receive less federal aid.\r\n\r\nFederal aid can be allocated in the form of competitive grants, which are likely to fluctuate from year to year. Federal aid is also awarded from formula grants that incorporate population and poverty statistics. \r\n\r\nCalifornia receives the highest total amount of federal funding at $43.61 billion. California, however, only receives net federal funding of $12 per resident. \r\n\r\nThe ten states with the highest total federal funding are:\r\n\r\n1.\tCalifornia ($43.61 billion)\r\n2.\tTexas ($26.90 billion)\r\n3.\tFlorida ($23.77 billion)\r\n4.\tNew York ($22.06 billion)\r\n5.\tVirginia ($17.68 billion)\r\n6.\tPennsylvania ($15.58 billion)\r\n7.\tIllinois ($13.18 billion)\r\n8.\tOhio ($12.57 billion)\r\n9.\tNorth Carolina ($11.31 billion)\r\n10.\tMichigan ($10.84 billion)\r\n\r\nNet federal funding per resident is the amount that a state received per capita from the government minus the amount that residents and organizations paid the government per capita.\r\n\r\nVirginia has the highest net federal funding per resident at $10,301 per resident. Unlike the previously mentioned trend, Virginia receives disproportionately high federal aid despite being one of the wealthier states in the US. This is could be attributed to their large defense contracting sectors. \r\n\r\nThe ten states with the highest net federal funding per resident are:\r\n\r\n1.\tVirginia ($10,301)\r\n2.\tKentucky ($9,145)\r\n3.\tNew Mexico ($8,692)\r\n4.\tWest Virginia ($7,283)\r\n5.\tAlaska ($7,048)\r\n6.\tMississippi ($6,880)\r\n7.\tAlabama ($6,694)\r\n8.\tMaryland ($6,035)\r\n9.\tMaine ($5,572)\r\n10.\tHawaii ($5,270)\r\n\r\nOn the opposite end, there are some states that have negative net federal funding. These states have paid to the federal government in taxes more than they receive back in aid. New Jersey has the largest negative net federal funding of \r\n-$2,368 per resident, closely followed by Massachusetts with -$2,343 per resident.\r\n\r\nThe ten states with the lowest net federal

During the fiscal year 2019, the federal government $4.45 trillion, 7.1% or $338 billion more than in fiscal year 2018. \r\n\r\nThe current U.S. government spending for the fiscal year 2020 is $4.746 trillion. Fiscal years start on October 1st and end September 30th of the following year. The fiscal year refers to the year it ends; therefore the fiscal year 2020 started on October 1, 2019, and will end September 30, 2020. The federal budget for FY 2020 is 21% of GDP. \r\n\r\nThe U.S. Treasury divides all federal spending into three groups: mandatory spending, discretionary spending, and interest on the national debt. Mandatory and discretionary spending account for more than 90% of all federal spending. Mandatory spending is spending that Congress legislates outside of the annual appropriations process. It consists mostly of [Social Security](https://www.thebalance.com/social-security-trust-fund-history-solvency-how-to-fix-it-3305890) and Medicare and also includes the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) among other things. \r\n\r\nAlmost two-thirds of federal spending goes toward paying mandatory spending. About 30% of spending goes towards paying for discretionary spending, essentially all federal government agencies, such as the military (the largest one), education and homeland security. About 10% of spending goes towards the interest the government pays on its accumulated debt.\r\n\r\nEvery year, workers in all 50 states pay taxes to the federal government. The federal government generates revenue from income and employment taxes and redistributes it to the states based on need in the form of grants, aid programs, and payment to major government contracting firms such as defense companies. A USA Today report shows that the [revenue is not distributed equally]( https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/economy/2019/03/20/how-much-federal-funding-each-state-receives-government/39202299/) among states. \r\n\r\nThe states that receive the most from Washington tend to have relatively poor populations that depend on federal assistance programs such as SNAP. The states that give the most to the federal government have higher-income residents and give more than they receive. The exceptions to this are Maryland and Virginia, which are both wealthier states; however, they receive disproportionately high federal funding, likely due to their defense sectors. \r\n\r\nCalifornia receives the most funding from the federal government. In fiscal year 2017, California received $436.1 billion from the federal government, spending about $12 per resident. The state of California spends this funding on pubic universities, local governments, private entities, and other entities such as Local Housing Authorities. \r\n\r\nTexas receives the second-highest amount of federal funding of $269.0 billion for fiscal year 2017. Texasâs net federal funding came out to about $304 per resident. Texas spends its funding on things such as K-12 educations, higher education, health \u0026 human services, and public safety. \r\n\r\nFlorida receives the third-highest amount of federal funding from the government. Floridaâs $237.7 billion revenue comes out to about -$2,187 per resident. Florida spending is causing concern as the state has recently been spending more than its revenue. The three-year outlook for the Florida state budget projects a deficit for fiscal year 2019 and 2020.\r\n\r\nNew York receives the fourth-highest total revenue from the federal government, receiving $220.6 billion in fiscal year 2017. Net federal funding is -$1,792 per resident. For fiscal year 2020, the three biggest state government programs are health care, education, and pensions. \r\n\r\nVirginia received $176.8 billion in total revenue from the federal government, the fifth-highest in the country. Virginiaâs net federal funding comes out to $10,301 per resident, the highest in the country. \r\n\r\nWyoming receives the least amount of total revenue from the federal government, followed by North Dakota, Vermont, South Dakota, and Delaware. All of these states are among the 10 least populated states in the U.S. \r\n","lastModified":"2020-04-06T20:09:05.156Z","path":"federal-spending-by-state","name":"Federal Spending By State"},{"article":"Who doesn't love their parents? After all, without their endless efforts and sacrifice, many of us may not be in the positions that we're currently in today. Therefore, we'd do anything in our power to take care of them when necessary. \n\nNow here's the twist: There are laws throughout the United States that require adult children to care for their elderly or ill parents. Not all states share the same ideals, though. To thoroughly understand the way these filial laws work, check out the laws enforced in various states. \n\n## Filial Laws\nFilial responsibility is defined as the following statement:\"... [laws that] impose a duty, usually upon adult children, for the support of their impoverished parents or other relatives.\" This law was enacted in various states after the Elizabethan Poor Law of 1601. Of course, since this enactment, there were significant changes to this law to adapt to current times.\n\nCurrently, 27 states and Puerto Rico have specific laws surrounding filial responsibility, with some of those states including:\n\n- California\n- Connecticut \n- Mississippi\n- Ohio\n\nOf course, each state sets its separate regulations surrounding this law, so it's crucial to learn the specifics of each area that abides by it. \n\n## Class/Income Level\nFor most states that apply these laws, the income level of the parent and child are taken into consideration. This rule is to help those who may not be able to care for their parents' debt in the future. \n\nIn most states, people who have low-income typically don't have to worry about these laws. Sometimes, this exception can apply to middle-class families if they all meet one condition: the parents must qualify for Medicaid. \n\nOf course, people with higher incomes still abide by the law since they can afford to take on their parents' debt if needed. Lower and some middle-income families, on the other hand, may require more help, which exempts them from this law. \n\n## Conditions\nUnder these laws, the adult children must care for their parents' bills and debt once they're unable to manage it themselves. Many of these debts include nursing home bills and other long-term bills. \n\nThe amount an adult child is liable to pay can decrease due to Medicare, Medicaid, or Social Security. If their parents qualify for any or all these programs, then the only expenses they'll have to pay for are personal expenses, like nursing home fees and personal items. \n","data":{"customMeta":{"relatedArticles":["abortion-laws-by-state","blue-laws-by-state","child-discipline-laws-by-state","clothing-laws-by-state","common-law-marriage-states","filial-responsibility-laws-by-state","final-paycheck-laws-by-state","gun-laws-by-state","helmet-law-states","homeschool-laws-by-state","incest-laws-by-state","late-fee-laws-by-state","magazine-capacity-laws-by-state","marijuana-laws-by-state","mushroom-laws-by-state","pepper-spray-laws-by-state","seat-belt-laws-by-state","states-with-stand-your-ground-laws","tiny-house-laws-by-state","voter-id-laws-by-state"]}},"lastModified":"2020-04-20T13:36:55.342Z","path":"filial-responsibility-laws-by-state","name":"Filial Responsibility Laws By State"},{"article":"When an employee leaves a business, the business owner must follow an employee termination checklist. In this checklist is the responsibility to give a terminated employee his or her final paycheck. \n\nFinal paycheck laws vary depending on the state your employees are in, but there are some general rules. Whether your employee quit or you terminated him/her, you must give them their last paycheck containing their regular wage from the most recent pay period.  You cannot withhold money from the employeeâs last paycheck, even if the employee owes your business, and you cannot attach a condition of receipt to the final paycheck. \n\nAs an employer, you must follow your stateâs final paycheck laws, and failing to do so can result in legal action. Many employers fail to comply out of ignorance. \n\nSome states require an employer to provide the final paycheck within a specific time frame, or immediately.

Paycheck Laws By State"},{"article":"Influenza, commonly known as the flu, is a contagious respiratory infection caused by viruses. It affects the nose, throat, and sometimes the lungs. The flu can be mild to severe, and sometimes fatal for high-risk groups. Symptoms include fever, cough, muscle aches, congestion, runny nose, and fatigue. The flu can be spread through saliva, physical contact, airborne respiratory droplets (coughing and sneezing), and contaminated surfaces. \r\n\r\nThe best way to prevent the flu is to get a flu shot every year. Because the virus changes from year to year, it is recommended that each person get a flu vaccine each year at the beginning of the flu season in the fall. The vaccine can help prevent the virus overall or, at the very least, can help keep the symptoms mild if contracted. Other ways to prevent the flu virus is to wash your hands consistently, avoid touching your face and eyes, and covering your nose and mouth when you sneeze using a tissue or the inside of your arm/elbow.\r\n\r\nWhile the flu can be easily avoided with a vaccine and precautionary steps, people still get the flu every year. The [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/fluactivitysurv.htm) consistently measure influenza activity throughout the United States and publishes a weekly surveillance report called [FluView](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/index.htm#ILIMap). FluView provides all up-to-date information about the flu virus, including activity estimates (sporadic, local activity, regional, and widespread) and levels of activity (minimal, low, moderate, and high).\r\n\r\nThere are ten states that have seen a decrease in flu rates. They are:\r\n\r\n-\tWyoming (- 0.93%)\r\n-\tWest Virginia (- 0.77%)\r\n-\tIllinois (- 0.32%)\r\n-\tHawaii (- 0.27%)\r\n-\tNew York (- 0.26%)\r\n-\tAlaska (- 0.23%)\r\n-\tLouisiana (- 0.16%)\r\n-\tConnecticut (- 0.13%)\r\n-\tRhode Island (- 0.05%)\r\n-\tKansas (- 0.02%)\r\n\r\nForty states have seen an increase in flu rates ranging from 0.03% to 2.05%. Overall, the states seeing the highest influenza activity are Louisiana with âhigh activityâ and Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, and Texas, all with âmoderate activity.â \r\n\r\nLouisiana is the only state with âhighâ influenza activity, with most cases being seen in the New Orleans metro area and southern points of the state. The number of cases so far in 2019 exceeds a national average, which is 2.4% of outpatient cases, while Louisianaâs stands at 4.6% - nearly double the national average. The number of cases in Louisiana is higher than the number of cases in the past five years. Because temperatures usually drop further before seeing an onslaught of influenza-like cases, officials are concerned that the numbers will only continue to grow. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","data":{"customMeta":{"relatedArticles":["abortion-rates-by-state","autism-rates-by-state","birth-rate-by-state","cancer-rates-by-state","circumcision-rates-by-state","corporate-tax-rates-by-state","crime-rate-by-state","depression-rates-by-state","employment-rate-by-state","flu-rates-by-state","infant-mortality-rate-by-state","labor-force-participation-rate-by-state","maternal-mortality-rate-by-state","murder-rate-by-state","obesity-rate-by-state","smoking-rates-by-state","state-tax-rates","suicide-rates-by-state","teen-pregnancy-rates-by-state","unemployment-rate-by-state","us-literacy-rates-by-state","vaccination-rates-by-state"]}},"lastModified":"2020-04-06T20:09:05.156Z","path":"flu-rates-by-state","name":"Flu Rates By State"},{"article":"In the United States, some travelers use the term âflyover statesâ to describe a specific region of the United States. Although some people define the term differently, itâs commonly defined as the interior region or geographic center of the United States located between the East and West Coasts.\n\nThese states are known as flyover states because when traveling from coast to coast, most travelers fly over these states without touching down. The term âflyover countryâ is also used when American travelers fly over a country and view it by air without ever landing in the country.\n\nTo determine the most common flyover states, ChampionTraveler conducted a study analyzing the ratio of destination flights to flyovers. This data showed that West Virginia is the most flown-over state. According to the data, there were nearly 2,400 flights to the state compared to over 466,000 flights over the state.\n\nThe next state on the list is Kansas. Kansas had over 9,700 flights to the state compared to over 507,000 flights over the state. Coming in third place was Mississippi, which had over 10,000 flights to the state compared to over 423,000 flights over the state.\n\nOther flyover states on this list include:\n\n- Iowa\n- Kentucky\n- Wyoming\n- Virginia\n- New Mexico\n- Arkansas\n- Alabama\n- South Dakota\n- Nebraska\n","data":{"states":["Iowa","Kentucky","Wyoming","Virginia","New Mexico","Arkansas","Alabama","South Dakota","Nebraska"],"customMeta":{"relatedArticles":["bible-belt-states","border-states","coastal-states",{"link":"4-corners-states","title":"Four Corners States"},"east-coast-states","eastern-states","flyover-states","gulf-states","great-lakes-states","lower-48-states",{"link":"midwest-states","title":"Midwestern United States"},{"link":"mid-atlantic-states","title":"Mid-Atlantic States"},"mountain-states","new-england-states","northern-states","rust-belt-states","southeast-states","southwest-states","west-coast-states"]}},"sources":[{"name":"Flyover States: Flight Data Shows Which States Americans Think Are Boring","link":"https://championtraveler.com/news/flyover-states-flight-data-shows-which-states-americans-think-are-boring/"}],"lastModified":"2020-04-06T20:09:05.156Z","path":"flyover-states","name":"Flyover States"},{"article":"Which states were free states?\r\n\r\nThe American Civil War was a war fought in the United States from 1862 to 1865. The war was fought between the North (the Union) and the South (the Confederacy) primarily due to the controversy over the enslavement of black people. \r\n\r\nIn February 1861, seven slave states of the South seceded from the country and organized the Confederate States of America. A total of 13 states joined the Confederate States. War broke out in April of 1861 when secessionist forces of the Confederate States attacked Fort Sumter. \r\n\r\nAt the end of the Civil War, the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution abolished slavery throughout the United States.\r\n\r\nJust before the Civil War, the United States had 34 total states, 19 of which were free states and 15 of which were slave states. A free state was a state in which slavery was either prohibited or being phased out. A slave state was one in which slavery was legal. \r\n\r\nFree states were generally located in the Union, and slave states were located in the Confederacy. The Mason-Dixon line was a boundary between Maryland and Pennsylvania that served as a dividing line between the slave states and the free states. At this time, however, there were also territories in the western United States that didnât necessarily follow the North-South divide when it came to slavery. Throughout the Civil War, some states become free states while some became free only at the end of the Civil War with the ratification of the Thirteenth Amendment.\r\n\r\n## Free States Prior to the Civil War\r\n\r\n-\tCalifornia\r\n-\tConnecticut\r\n-\tIllinois\r\n-\tIndiana\r\n-\tIowa\r\n-\tMaine\r\n-\tMassachusetts\r\n-\tMichigan\r\n-\tNew Hampshire\r\n-\tNew York\r\n-\tNew Jersey\r\n-\tOhio\r\n-\tPennsylvania\r\n-\tRhode Island\r\n-\tVermont\r\n-\tWisconsin\r\n\r\n## Slave States Prior to the Civil War\r\n\r\n-\tAlabama\r\n-\tArkansas\r\n-\tDelaware\r\n-\tFlorida \r\n-\tGeorgia\r\n-\tKentucky\r\n-\tLouisiana\r\n-\tMaryland\r\n-\tMississippi\r\n-\tMissouri\r\n-\tNorth Carolina\r\n-\tSouth Carolina\r\n-\tTennessee\r\n-\tTexas\r\n-\tVirginia\r\n\r\n## Civil War Free States\r\n\r\n-\tCalifornia\r\n-\tConnecticut\r\n-\tIllinois\r\n-\tIndiana\r\n-\tIowa\r\n-\tKansas\r\n-\tMaine\r\n-\tMassachusetts\r\n-\tMichigan\r\n-\tMinnesota\r\n-\tNevada\r\n-\tNew Hampshire\r\n-\tNew Jersey\r\n-\tNew York\r\n-\tOhio\r\n-\tOregon\r\n-\tPennsylvania\r\n-\tRhode Island\r\n-\tVermont\r\n-\tWest Virginia\r\n-\tWisconsin\r\n\r\n## Civil War Slave States\r\n\r\n-\tAlabama\r\n-\tArkansas\r\n-\tFlorida\r\n-\tGeorgia\r\n-\tLouisiana\r\n-\tMississippi\r\n-\tNorth Carolina\r\n-\tSouth Carolina\r\n-\tTennessee\r\n-\tTexas Virginia\r\n","sources":[{"name":"Free And Slave States Map â State, Territory, And City Populations","link":"http://www.nellaware.com/blog/free-and-slave-states-map-state-territory-and-city-populations.html"}],"lastModified":"2020-04-06T20:09:05.156Z","path":"free-states","name":"Free States"},{"article":"The Gas Tax by state ranges from 14.65 cents per gallon to 57.6 cents per gallon. For diesel, the tax ranges from 12.75 cents per gallon to 74.1 cents per gallon. In general, there is a high correlation between gasoline state tax and diesel state tax.\n\nPennsylvania is the high outlier for both gas tax (14.65 cents per gallon) and diesel tax (74.1 cents per gallon). Alaska is the lowest prices, though not an outlier, for both gas tax (14.65 cents per gallon) and diesel tax (12.75 cents per gallon).\n\nThe average gas tax by state is 29.15 cents per gallon. 23 states have gas taxes higher than that average, and 27 states have gas taxes lower than that average. This means that the gas tax is relatively well distributed throughout the USâit skewed only slightly toward states with lower taxes.\n\nThe average diesel tax by state is 30.46 cents per gallon. 21 states have diesel taxes higher than the average, and 29 states have diesel taxes lower than the average. This is more skewed than the gas tax, and states tend to have lower-than-average taxes for diesel.\n\n21 states have a diesel tax that is exactly the same as itâs gas tax, with a few more being within .5 cents. 6 states (Pennsylvania, California, New Jersey, Ohio, Arizona, and Indiana) have diesel taxes which are significantly higher (greater or equal to 5 cents per gallon) than their gas tax. The greatest disparity is in California, where diesel tax is 19.3 cents per gallon higher than the diesel tax.\n\nWhile several states have diesel taxes that are only marginally lower than their gas tax (within 2 cents per gallon), only Illinois has a diesel tax that is significantly lower than itâs gas tax. Illinoisâs diesel tax is 16.5 cents per gallon lower than its gas tax.\n\nThe geographical correlation for gas taxes is relatively weak, but in general the West Coast has the highest prices, followed closely by the East Coast. The inland United States is generally split north to south, with the north generally having higher taxes than the south.

Though it makes sense to refer to states as having a GDP, you might run into situations where the economic performance of a state is referred to as the GSP, which stands for gross state product. Either way, for the sake of this article, we will be calling them GDP values. \n\nSince we are looking at the GDP by state in the United States of America, the GDP helps to inform people about how well a state is doing in terms of the state's economy. The GDP of a state refers to the overall production and distribution of goods in a state. You will find that GDP values are listed as dollar amounts because it is a monetary representation of how much a state either brought in or spent on a quarterly basis. \n\nThese are two different ways of viewing GDP in a country. The income approach is the former of the two, and it is defined by calculating how much money everyone in a certain location kept as profits over the course of a year. The expenditure method of determining GDP is the exact opposite way of calculating gross domestic product for a particular state, but the value should still be relatively similar, if not identical. The expenditure method looks at how much money people spent in a given year, compared to how much they made in total. \n\nSince an annual GDP value cannot be determined until the year in focus comes to an end, the most recent GDP reports reflect the outcomes of 2018. The GDP values by state for 2019 will be available in 2020, and so on and so forth. \n\nThe gross domestic product of a state is calculated every three months. With this quarterly system in place, the progression or digression of the GDP in each state can be seen so state governments can understand how their economy performed throughout the year. Looking at economical performance from one year to the next is important in order to see where the state is thriving and where the state could use additional effort, but it is more informative for the GDP values to reflect shorter periods of time. \n\nA lot of changes take place on a month-to-month basis, and economies are already very fluctuating variables, so it makes more sense to view trends on a smaller scale than reflecting on GDP values once at the end of every year. Now that we understand that GDP values reflect the economic performance of a state, letâs start looking at numbers! \n\nHere are the percentages of change between the third quarter GDP values and the fourth quarter [GDP values by state](https://www.bea.gov/system/files/2019-04/qgdpstate0519_4.pdf) for the year 2018...\n\n- Alabama  2.1\n- Alaska  4.9\n- Arizona  3.5\n- Arkansas  1.5\n- California  2.2\n- Colorado  3.8\n- Connecticut  1.8\n- Delaware  0.0\n- Florida  2.0\n- Georgia  2.1\n- Hawaii  1.1\n- Idaho  2.7\n- Illinois  1.3\n- Indiana  0.9\n- Iowa  0.3\n- Kansas  0.9 \n- Kentucky  1.8\n- Louisiana  1.3\n- Maine  0.7\n- Maryland  1.2\n- Massachusetts  1.8\n- Michigan  1.8\n- Minnesota  1.1\n- Mississippi  0.5\n- Missouri  1.8\n- Montana  1.3\n- Nebraska  2.2\n- Nevada  2.8\n- New Hampshire  1.7\n- New Jersey  1.8\n- New Mexico  4.1\n- New York  0.2\n- North Carolina  1.9\n- North Dakota  3.5\n- Ohio  1.4\n- Oklahoma  5.5\n- Oregon  1.3\n- Pennsylvania  2.5\n- Rhode Island  1.0\n- South Carolina  1.6\n- South Dakota  2.1\n- Tennessee  1.6\n- Texas  6.6\n- Utah  1.8\n- Vermont  1.9\n- Virginia  1.5\n- Washington  3.1\n- West Virginia  1.8\n- Wisconsin  2.1\n- Wyoming  6.0\n\n## GDP by State in 2017\n\nLooking back in history is never a bad idea. While many unfortunate events have happened and many ill circumstances have transpired, viewing how everything used to be helps people in present time understand how far everyone has come. In order to fully know if the states in America have experienced a better year in terms of individual GDP values, or if the economy of a state has actually performed less well than usual in 2018, it is helpful to reflect on the previous year and compare values between the two. \n\nLooking at the GDP by state in 2018 only tells you how each state performed in a given year. But if you want to see what those GDP values mean in terms of improvement and change, it is helpful to look back at the year before and see how GDP values compare between 2017 and 2018. \n\nHere are

(GDP) is the monetary market value of all final goods and services made within a geographic location during a specific period. It includes all private and public consumption, investments, the foreign balance of trade (exports are added to GDP, imports are subtracted) and government outlays. GDP is an overall measure of domestic production; therefore it is used as a snapshot of a country or regionâs economic health.\r\n \r\nGDP growth rate is the increase in GDP from quarter to quarter. The GDP growth rate is important for government entities, which use it to determine which monetary policies to implement, and businesses, which use it to guide their business strategy. A very high GDP growth rate is not always good, as it could be an indicator of environmental impacts or an increase in income disparity or inflation. In these cases, the government entities would use the GDP growth rate to implement monetary policy to slow down the growth.\r\n \r\nThe United States GDP was $20.50 trillion in 2018 with a growth rate of 2.9%. As with many other things, GDP varies greatly in each of the 50 states and the District of Columbia, with some states having GDPs that rival entire countries. For example, Texasâs economy of $1.8 trillion is larger than the economy of global superpower Russia.\r\n \r\nIn 2018, 49 states and the District of Columbia saw GDP growth. Only Alaska saw a decrease of -0.3%. Alaskaâs GDP was about $52.31 billion and ranked as the 46th largest economy in the United States. Alaskaâs economy is based on oil production, fishing, mining, research and development, and tourism.\r\n \r\nWashington had the largest growth rate in 2018 of 5.7% almost double the national rate. The boost to the stateâs economy is provided mainly from the information services and retail sectors. Washingtonâs consistent growth has propelled it from the 17th largest economy in the United States in 1977 to the 10th largest economy. \r\n \r\nThe fastest-growing economies in the United States for 2018 with higher GDP growth rates than the national rate are Washington, Utah, Idaho, Arizona, and Florida, California, Colorado, Oregon, Nevada, Texas, and Tennessee.\r\n \r\nBelow is a table of

cards are unique gifts to give anyone for a special occasion. Not only are they the more preferred gift for the receiver, but they are also practical and pose fewer issues than buying an actual gift. Despite this, many laws are surrounding these cards that cannot be ignored. If an individual can educate themselves about these laws, especially in the state they reside, theyâll have no issues with the card after the purchase.\n\n## Expiration Dates\nBecause of the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act (CARD), gift cards cannot expire for five years. This rule is a federal law that applies to every state in the country. \n\nAlso, the receiver of the gift card must know of any terms and conditions that come with the card. This rule includes any information about the expiration date. However, some states have enforced specific circumstances to this rule that the receiver must follow. \n\nTo view the specific laws regarding expiration dates in each state, check out this chart for more information. \n\n## Fees\nWhen it comes to fees, each state has different laws regarding the charges someone can have during a transaction. However, some fee laws apply to every state, and those are:\n\nThere must be a disclosure of any fees either on the card or on the packaging of the card.\nIf states allow post-sale fees, then these fees cannot apply until after one year of inactivity. \nThere shouldn't be more than one post-sale fee per month.\n\nOn the other hand, some states make their versions of laws and legislation about post-sale fees for gift cards. These fees are charged after a purchase has occurred and includes:\n\n- Maintenance fees\n- Activation fees\n- Transaction fees\n\nOnce again, it is required by federal law that these fees are disclosed somewhere with the gift card. \n\n## Redemptions\nSometimes when people havenât used their gift cards entirely, they can cash in the remaining amount. However, this does come with some conditions and rules, especially in different states. \n\nIn some states, people can only redeem gift cards once they reach a specific amount. This amount is typically small, like $5-$10, but it could be a more significant amount in other states. \n\nMany states, on the other hand, do not apply this rule to gift cards. They will require individuals to spend all the money on the gift card until it expires. If the person still has a balance once the gift cards expire, then that balance will be turned over to the state:\n\n- After five years of inactivity \n- After two years of inactivity\n\nThis time frame of when the money is turned over to the state solely depends on where a person lives. \n","lastModified":"2020-04-20T13:36:55.342Z","path":"gift-card-laws-by-state","name":"Gift Card Laws By State"},{"article":"The Great Lake States, those eight states that share a boarder with the five great lakes, are (from west to east) Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois, Michigan, Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New York. The area, known geologically as the Great Lakes Basin, contains the watersheds of Hudson Bay, and the Mississippi, St. Lawrence, Richelieu, Hudson, Mohawk, and Susquehanna rivers, many of which feed into the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nAt six quadrillion gallons, it contains twenty percent (1/5) of the total freshwater on the surface of the planet. It also contains 84% of the freshwater surface in North America. It is these geological features that have allowed the Great Lake States to have the largest economy on the planet, when considered as a whole (see below).\n\nThe eight Great Lake States, along with the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Quebec, are part of the Great Lakes Megalopolis, the largest chain of cities in North America. In the United States alone, the cities in this region have a population of nearly 30 million. This comes in at just under 10% of the total population of the United States.\n\nWhile there is no information about the total land area of these states, the total shoreline is about 10,000 miles, or about 40% of the earthâs circumference.\n\nThe Great Lake States are world leaders in manufacturing, research, and development, particularly in the automobile industry.\n\nAccording to theÂ Brookings Institution, when taken as a single unit, and without Canadaâs provinces, the U.S. Great Lake States are one of the largest economies in the world.

Some deaths are point-blank murders, many are suicides, and many gun-related deaths happen by accident, due to negligent behavior or children getting their hands on weapons and firing a shot without knowing any better. \n\nGun violence statistics across the United States are alarming. About [seventy-two percent](https://www.safehome.org/resources/gun-laws-and-deaths/) of all murders across the nation involve the use of guns. According to the Department of Justice, 60% of adult firearm deaths are by suicide. The US has more than 33,000 gun deaths per year. In 2017, there were 39,773 deaths by firearms, the highest since 1986. Of these deaths, 23,854 were by suicide and 14,542 were homicides; which is 12 deaths per 100,000 people and seven deaths per 100,000 people respectively.\n\nSuicides account for the highest number of gun-related deaths by state in the United States of America.  Most people who have killed themselves with firearms of some type were also the registered and licensed owners of the weapons as well. A correlation that research has uncovered is that people in states with lower population density values are more likely to commit suicide by way of a gun. The thought behind this finding is that lower population densities mean lower rates of loneliness, isolation, and lack of purpose. \n\nOn this note, the states with the highest suicide rates are Montana, Alaska, and Wyoming, as well as various smaller cities in midwestern states of America. On the other end of the spectrum, states with large population sizes and even larger population density values, such as New Jersey, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts, have the lowest suicide rates in the United States. \n\nFirearm deaths per year are not just a reflection of citizens failing to get along or respect each other's rights to life. Firearms have also been involved in the attempted assassinations of eleven presidents of the United States. Four presidents were killed by bullet wounds, but the point is that three handguns and one rifle were the weapons of choice for shooting, injuring, and ultimately killing four US presidents (Lincoln, Garfield, McKinley, Kennedy).\n\nAs of January of 2019, it is reported that the top five US states with the high rates of gun-related deaths are... \n\n1. Alaska - In Alaska, about fifty-six percent of all homes contain at least one gun. \n2. Montana - In Montana, sixty-seven-and-a-half percent of all households have a gun in the home. \n3. Alabama - There is a gun in roughly fifty-percent of all Alabama households. \n4. Louisiana - Forty-nine percent of homes in Louisiana have a gun inside. \n5. Missouri - A gun can be found in just below forty-four percent of all Missourian houses. \n\nThe five states that have the lowest rates of gun-related deaths, in order from lowest deaths related to gun injuries, areâ¦\n\n1. Hawaii - As the state with the fewest guns per household, twelve-and-a-half percent of all homes in Hawaii have a gun within the walls. \n2. Massachusetts - Fourteen-point-three percent of all homes in Massachusetts contain a gun. \n3. Rhode Island - As the state with the fourth lowest number of gun-related deaths, about fifteen-point-nine percent of all homes in Rhode Island have a gun in the household.\n4. New York - Firearms exist in about twenty-two-point-two percent of houses in New York. \n5. Connecticut - The homes in Connecticut are tied with the percentage of homes in New York that have firearms, which comes to a total of about twenty-two-point-two percent.\n\nWhat percentage of Americans own guns? The United States has the highest percentage of gun ownership in the world. There are 120 firearms per 100 people in the US with 30% of Americans owning at least one gun and 43%. That means that the majority of gun owners own more than one firearm. According to the [Pew Research Center](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/10/22/facts-about-guns-in-united-states/), two-thirds of gun owners own more than one firearm and 29% own five or more. \n\nHow many Americans own guns? There are over 98 million gun owners in the United States. These gun owners own more guns than there are people in the United States, with a total of over 390 million guns for 327 million people. \n\nThe nation that ranks as number two on this list of gun-owning countries is Yemen, and even so, Yemen's population is shown to have about fifty-five guns per one hundred people. If anything, a little over fifty percent of Yemen's population owns guns, and it's possible that less than fifty percent of the population can be considered gun owners. Instead, it is likely that there are fewer gun owners and just multiple guns per gun-owning household. \n\nThese speculations of how many citizens own guns in the United States are just that -- speculations. However, what can be said for certain is that the United States of America is home to far more guns than any other countries in the world. This is a main contributor to the horrific rates of [gun deaths by state](https://www.thetrace.org/2018/12/gun-violence-facts-statistics-2018/) in America. \n\nMany states in the US do not have [strong firearm laws](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-41488081) or strict gun ownership rules. As a result, an abundance of gun-related injuries take place in states where gun laws arenât strong. In fact, guns caused so much damage and so many losses of lives in 2018 that younger voters were more eager to vote on election day than ever. Millennials and Generation Z children have been majorly affected by gun violence in America. \n\nAs a unit, they were so appalled by the school shootings, deaths, and presence of guns in the hands of so many people on American soil. The elections of 2018 saw a high turnout of young voters and statistics showed that gun violence in the United States was a main player in their activism.

Deaths Per Capita By State"},{"article":"Unlike many federal laws, state gun laws are mandated by state-level governments. Since gun laws are regulated on a state level, the laws surrounding guns vary from one state to the next. There are many federal firearm laws in place and they are applicable to all fifty states, but beyond the laws set forth by the federal government, state gun laws cannot be changed by the federal government. \n\nPolitical viewpoints and party affiliations play a part in the state gun laws because, truth be told, guns are a political discussion. Some parts of the United States have gun laws that are looser than the regulations set forth by the federal government, but some states are at the other extreme, with stricter enforced gun laws than those of the federal government. \n\nWhen you hear the term of federal firearms laws, you might be under the assumption that it is absolutely required that citizens abide by them since they are being put forth at such an official level of authority. However, this is actually not the case! \n\nThe result of a court case between Printz and the United States government, the Supreme Court justices ruled that local state governments do not have uphold and enforce the firearms laws of the federal government. The more you know! Forty of the fifty states in the US have something in place that protects their residents' access to the second amendment, which is the right to bear arms. \n\n## Federal Firearms Laws in the United States \n\nThe act of carrying firearms in the United States can be defined in two different ways, and you'll see each of these descriptions pop up in discussions about state gun laws in the US. You can either carry a firearm as a concealed carry weapon or as an open carry weapon. \n\nConcealed carry firearms are tucked away and not visible to people around you, whereas an open carry firearm is out in the open without any attempt to disclose the fact that you have a weapon on your person. Each state level government is in charge of how their residents are allowed to carry firearms within that particular state's borders. \n\nLikewise, states determine whether or not you need a permit to carry weapons in public spaces. There are not any states that explicitly deny citizens the right to bear arms, primarily because this is technically illegal, given the nature of the United States Constitution. \n\nHowever, states can get around the illegality of banning their residents from carrying weapons by making an application process as daunting, exhaustive, and lengthy as possible. In doing so, people either give up or do not meet the requirements necessary for obtaining a permit, and therefore, carrying a firearm is not possible after all. \n\n## State Level Gun Law Statistics\n\n- Seven US states completely ban any and all open carry activity. \n- Only eight of the fifty states require that people who own firearms register their weapons with the state. \n- Twenty-two states in the US enforce regulations known as deadly force laws. \n\nThere is also something called the Stand Your Ground Law. For many people, this law creates instances where murder is excusable and legal. For others, they are in full support of the right to defend their property, selves, families, and belongings. No matter your opinion on the law, the truth of the matter is that twenty-seven states in the US uphold the Stand Your Ground Law. \n\nEssentially, this state-level law permits people to use deadly force if it is under the category of protecting themselves. This is a very loose way of defining the law, which is why so many different issues arise from it. Reasons and restrictions for using deadly force on an intruder, a stranger, or a person you know includeâ¦\n\n- Their behavior is unlawful or dangerous.\n- Someone is breaking into your home, office, car, or other piece of property. \n- Nothing you have done prompted the behavior of the individual. \n- The intruder is not a police officer on duty.\n- The genuine possibility or fear that the intruding person will inflict serious harm should he or she enter the premises. \n\n## Individual States and their Gun Laws as of 2019\n\nNow, for a look into the individual states and whether you canâ¦\n\n- Carry your handgun without a permit\n- Purchase a handgun without a permit\n- Own a handgun without registering it\n- Open carry your handgun \n\n...in each of the fifty US states.\n","data":{"states":["Michigan","Washington","Maryland","Connecticut","Hawaii","California","New York","New Jersey"],"customMeta":{"columns":["state",{"header":"Firearm Registration

Estimates show that there are anywhere from over 200 million to more than 350 million guns in the U.S. Because of variances in regulations throughout the nation, itâs impossible to get exact numbers when it comes to the total number of guns in the nation and the number of guns in each state. However, the Pew Research Center has compiled data that is about as accurate as it gets. \n\nBefore diving into gun ownership stats by state, letâs take a look at some general gun statistics throughout the nation. According to the Pew Research Center, the South United States has the highest amount of gun owners, with about 36% of residents living in this region owning a gun. The Midwest and West each respectively have gun ownership levels that exceed 30%, while the Northeast has the lowest number of gun owners at about 16%. Most guns in the United States are owned by rural households, while more men own guns than women. \n\nNow, letâs take a look at gun ownership by state. Itâs important to note that weâre looking at the total percentage of gun ownership based on population. While one state may have more guns, the population may also be higher. For the purposes of this article, weâre focusing on the total percentage of gun ownership in relation to the stateâs population. \n\nBased on this, the state of Alaska has the highest rate of gun ownership at 61.7% in its population of over 735,000. Arkansas has the next highest percentage of gun owners at 57.9% with its population of over 3 million. \n\nThere are several other states which have gun ownership percentages that exceed 50%. That includes Idaho, West Virginia, Wyoming, and Montana. \n\nOn the other side of the scale, we have the states with the lowest percentage of gun owners. Delaware â a state with a population reaching nearly one million â has a very low gun ownership rate of 5.2%. Rhode Island isnât far behind with a rate of 5.8% across over 1 million residents. These are the only two states with gun ownership rates that fall below 10%. \n\nOther states with low rates of gun ownership (less than 20%) include New York, New Jersey, New Hampshire, Connecticut, Ohio, and Nebraska. \n","data":{"states":[],"customMeta":{"columns":["state",{"header":"Gun Ownership","field":"gunOwnership","format":"perc"},{"header":"Registered Guns","field":"totalGuns","format":"numberWithCommas"},"population"],"sortField":"gunOwnership","showAllStates":true,"sortAsc":false,"tileMap":{"field":"gunOwnership"},"scatterChartFields":[{"field":"gunOwnership","title":"Gun Ownership %","label":""}],"relatedArticles":["best-states-for-gun-owners","concealed-carry-states","concealed-carry-reciprocity-states","constitutional-carry-states","gun-deaths-by-state","gun-deaths-per-capita-by-state","gun-laws-by-state","gun-ownership-by-state","gun-violence-by-state","guns-per-capita","magazine-capacity-laws-by-state","open-carry-states"]},"customData":[{"state":"Alabama","gunOwnership":0.489,"totalGuns":161641},{"state":"Alaska","gunOwnership":0.617,"totalGuns":15824},{"state":"Arizona","gunOwnership":0.323,"totalGuns":179738},{"state":"Arkansas","gunOwnership":0.579,"totalGuns":79841},{"state":"California","gunOwnership":0.201,"totalGuns":344622},{"state":"Colorado","gunOwnership":0.343,"totalGuns":92435},{"state":"Connecticut","gunOwnership":0.166,"totalGuns":82400},{"state":"Delaware","gunOwnership":0.052,"totalGuns":4852},{"state":"Florida","gunOwnership":0.325,"totalGuns":343288},{"state":"Georgia","gunOwnership":0.316,"totalGuns":190050},{"state":"Hawaii","gunOwnership":0.451,"totalGuns":7859},{"state":"Idaho","gunOwnership":0.569,"totalGuns":49566},{"state":"Illinois","gunOwnership":0.262,"totalGuns":146487},{"state":"Indiana","gunOwnership":0.338,"totalGuns":114019},{"state":"Iowa","gunOwnership":0.338,"totalGuns":28494},{"state":"Kansas","gunOwnership":0.322,"totalGuns":52634},{"state":"Kentucky","gunOwnership":0.424,"totalGuns":81058},{"state":"Louisiana","gunOwnership":0.445,"totalGuns":116831},{"state":"Maine","gunOwnership":0.226,"totalGuns":15371},{"state":"Maryland","gunOwnership":0.207,"totalGuns":103109},{"state":"Massachusetts","gunOwnership":0.226,"totalGuns":37152},{"state":"Michigan","gunOwnership":0.288,"totalGuns":65742},{"state":"Minnesota","gunOwnership":0.367,"totalGuns":79307},{"state":"Mississippi","gunOwnership":0.428,"totalGuns":35494},{"state":"Missouri","gunOwnership":0.271,"totalGuns":72995},{"state":"Montana","gunOwnership":0.523,"totalGuns":22133},{"state":"Nebraska","gunOwnership":0.198,"totalGuns":22234},{"state":"Nevada","gunOwnership":0.375,"totalGuns":76888},{"state":"New Hampshire","gunOwnership":0.144,"totalGuns":64135},{"state":"New Jersey","gunOwnership":0.113,"totalGuns":57505},{"state":"New Mexico","gunOwnership":0.499,"totalGuns":97580},{"state":"New York","gunOwnership":0.103,"totalGuns":76207},{"state":"North Carolina","gunOwnership":0.287,"totalGuns":152238},{"state":"North Dakota","gunOwnership":0.479,"totalGuns":13272},{"state":"Ohio","gunOwnership":0.196,"totalGuns":173405},{"state":"Oklahoma","gunOwnership":0.312,"totalGuns":71269},{"state":"Oregon","gunOwnership":0.266,"totalGuns":61383},{"state":"Pennsylvania","gunOwnership":0.271,"totalGuns":236377},{"state":"Rhode Island","gunOwnership":0.058,"totalGuns":4223},{"state":"South Carolina","gunOwnership":0.444,"totalGuns":105601},{"state":"South Dakota","gunOwnership":0.35,"totalGuns":21130},{"state":"Tennessee","gunOwnership":0.394,"totalGuns":99159},{"state":"Texas","gunOwnership":0.357,"totalGuns":588696},{"state":"Utah","gunOwnership":0.319,"totalGuns":72856},{"state":"Vermont","gunOwnership":0.288,"totalGuns":5872},{"state":"Virginia","gunOwnership":0.293,"totalGuns":307822},{"state":"Washington","gunOwnership":0.277,"totalGuns":91835},{"state":"West Virginia","gunOwnership":0.542,"totalGuns":35264},{"state":"Wisconsin","gunOwnership":0.347,"totalGuns":64878},{"state":"Wyoming","gunOwnership":0.538,"totalGuns":132806}]},"sources":[{"name":"What Is Gun Ownership Like State by State","link":"https://www.thoughtco.com/gun-owners-percentage-of-state-populations-3325153"}],"lastModified":"2020-04-06T20:09:05.156Z","path":"gun-ownership-by-state","name":"Gun Ownership By State"},{"article":"The United States has a very troubling problem when it comes to gun laws, deaths, and violence inflicted by the use of firearms. It is estimated that about one hundred people are killed every day due to gun-related injuries.\n\nThe estimated number of deaths that occur every year as a result of [gun violence in America](https://everytownresearch.org/gun-violence-america/) is about 36,383 deaths annually. As we mentioned, gun violence does not always end in deaths. However, the outcome is usually some form of an injury or another. In fact, the majority of people involved in gun violence, whether they be the perpetrators or the victims, do not leave the scene unscathed. There are about 100,120 people injured by gun violence in America every year. And these values only account for situations where violence was an intention in the minds of those who committed firearm-related violence.\n\nOn the topic of gun-related injuries, a lot of cases of gun violence involve serious assault even though homicides are not the final outcome. Race becomes a serious main player when looking into the victims and perpetrators of gun violence in America, both on a state-by-state basis and a nationwide level. An unfortunate and backwards truth in the United States is that young, black boys are the most likely people to experience gun violence. It is fifteen times more likely that a black male will be the victim of a gun-related violent attack than their white, Hispanic, Indian, Asian, and other counterparts. \n\nOn top of racial biases, another problem that comes into play when looking at American gun violence is that a great deal of victims are attacked during disputes related to domestic violence instances. It is far more likely that a woman will be the victim of gun violence in an abusive household, and it is equally as likely that the perpetrator of the violence is a male partner, ex-partner, or relative of the victim. As of 2019, there is an estimated number of fifty-two women who are actually killed in instances of gun violence during domestic violence confrontations. \n\nGun violence that transpires within households is very impactful on children in America. This plays into the statistic that roughly three million kids see gun violence take place in the United States in a given year. This detail goes even further into the realm of tragedy when you learn that firearms are actually the second most likely killer of children in the United States, falling right behind accidents involving children and motor vehicles. The other three top five causes of the deaths of American children are being diagnosed with cancer, passing out from suffocation, and being poisoned by various substances. \n\nThe most precise and conclusive data surrounding gun violence in America points to data collected by the CDC in 2017. The Centers for Disease Control compiled information regarding the death rates that occurred as a result of gun violence in 2017.\n\nForty-one out of fifty states in total do not require permits in order to be a gun owner. In order to [obtain a gun permit](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2018/02/21/states-most-and-least-gun-violence-see-where-your-state-stacks-up/359395002/), you have to endure an intensive background check. As a result, placing a gun in the hands of someone who does not get cleared might mean that guns are bought by people who have a history of violence, criminal activity, or other dangerous behaviors. \n\nThe seven states that always require gun permits in order to purchase and carry a firearm includeâ¦ \n\n- Connecticut \n- Hawaii \n- Illinois \n- Iowa \n- Massachusetts \n- New Jersey \n- Wisconsin \n\nBelow are the fifty states in descending order of [gun violence](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/sosmap/firearm_mortality/firearm.htm) per year in America.\n","data":{"states":[],"customMeta":{"columns":["state",{"header":"Death Rate (per 100k people)","field":"rate","format":"percAlt"},{"header":"Total Deaths","field":"deaths","format":"numberWithCommas"},{"header":"Permit Req'd. for Firearm Ownership","field":"reqPermit","format":"yes/no"},"population"],"sortField":"rate","sortAsc":false,"showAllStates":true,"chloroMap":{"field":"rate"},"relatedArticles":["best-states-for-gun-owners","concealed-carry-states","concealed-carry-reciprocity-states","constitutional-carry-states","gun-deaths-by-state","gun-deaths-per-capita-by-state","gun-laws-by-state","gun-ownership-by-state","gun-violence-by-state","guns-per-capita","magazine-capacity-laws-by-state","open-carry-states"]},"customData":[{"deaths":1124,"rate":22.9,"reqPermit":false,"state":"Alabama"},{"deaths":180,"rate":24.5,"reqPermit":false,"state":"Alaska"},{"deaths":1134,"rate":15.8,"reqPermit":false,"state":"Arizona"},{"deaths":613,"rate":20.3,"reqPermit":false,"state":"Arkansas"},{"deaths":3184,"rate":7.9,"reqPermit":false,"state":"California"},{"deaths":779,"rate":13.4,"reqPermit":false,"state":"Colorado"},{"deaths":188,"rate":5.1,"reqPermit":true,"state":"Connecticut"},{"deaths":111,"rate":11.7,"reqPermit":false,"state":"Delaware"},{"deaths":2724,"rate":12.4,"reqPermit":false,"state":"Florida"},{"deaths":1623,"rate":15.4,"reqPermit":false,"state":"Georgia"},{"deaths":39,"rate":2.5,"reqPermit":true,"state":"Hawaii"},{"deaths":280,"rate":16.4,"reqPermit":false,"state":"Idaho"},{"deaths":1543,"rate":12.1,"reqPermit":true,"state":"Illinois"},{"deaths":1016,"rate":15.3,"reqPermit":false,"state":"Indiana"},{"deaths":293,"rate":9,"reqPermit":true,"state":"Iowa"},{"deaths":466,"rate":16,"reqPermit":false,"state":"Kansas"},{"deaths":730,"rate":16.2,"reqPermit":false,"state":"Kentucky"},{"deaths":1008,"rate":21.7,"reqPermit":false,"state":"Louisiana"},{"deaths":172,"rate":11.7,"reqPermit":false,"state":"Maine"},{"deaths":742,"rate":12.3,"reqPermit":false,"state":"Maryland"},{"deaths":262,"rate":3.7,"reqPermit":true,"state":"Massachusetts"},{"deaths":1138,"rate":11.3,"reqPermit":false,"state":"Michigan"},{"deaths":465,"rate":8.2,"reqPermit":false,"state":"Minnesota"},{"deaths":632,"rate":21.5,"reqPermit":false,"state":"Mississippi"},{"deaths":1307,"rate":21.5,"reqPermit":false,"state":"Missouri"},{"deaths":244,"rate":22.5,"reqPermit":false,"state":"Montana"},{"deaths":160,"rate":8.3,"reqPermit":false,"state":"Nebraska"},{"deaths":508,"rate":16.7,"reqPermit":false,"state":"Nevada"},{"deaths":146,"rate":10.4,"reqPermit":false,"state":"New Hampshire"},{"deaths":478,"rate":5.3,"reqPermit":true,"state":"New Jersey"},{"deaths":394,"rate":18.5,"reqPermit":false,"state":"New Mexico"},{"deaths":772,"rate":3.7,"reqPermit":false,"state":"New York"},{"deaths":1430,"rate":13.7,"reqPermit":false,"state":"North Carolina"},{"deaths":103,"rate":13.2,"reqPermit":false,"state":"North Dakota"},{"deaths":1589,"rate":13.7,"reqPermit":false,"state":"Ohio"},{"deaths":681,"rate":17.2,"reqPermit":false,"state":"Oklahoma"},{"deaths":528,"rate":12.1,"reqPermit":false,"state":"Oregon"},{"deaths":1636,"rate":12.5,"reqPermit":false,"state":"Pennsylvania"},{"deaths":43,"rate":3.9,"reqPermit":false,"state":"Rhode Island"},{"deaths":893,"rate":17.7,"reqPermit":false,"state":"South Carolina"},{"deaths":101,"rate":11.9,"reqPermit":false,"state":"South Dakota"},{"deaths":1246,"rate":18.4,"reqPermit":false,"state":"Tennessee"},{"deaths":3513,"rate":12.4,"reqPermit":false,"state":"Texas"},{"deaths":410,"rate":14,"reqPermit":false,"state":"Utah"},{"deaths":70,"rate":11.7,"reqPermit":false,"state":"Vermont"},{"deaths":1041,"rate":11.9,"reqPermit":false,"state":"Virginia"},{"deaths":849,"rate":11.1,"reqPermit":false,"state":"Washington"},{"deaths":348,"rate":18.6,"reqPermit":false,"state":"West Virginia"},{"deaths":624,"rate":10.6,"reqPermit":true,"state":"Wisconsin"},{"deaths":113,"rate":18.8,"reqPermit":false,"state":"Wyoming"}]},"sources":[{"name":"CDC.gov: Firearm Mortality by State","link":"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/sosmap/firearm_mortality/firearm.htm"},{"name":"States with the most (and least) gun violence.

Some days we are sad, and some we are happy. We can feel happiness because of a promotion, an upcoming trip, time with family, or the place we live. Happiness is based on several factors, both internal and external, and some more important than others. Some states in the U.S. are considered happier than others. However, can you measure happiness?\n\nIn order to determine which states are the happiest in the United States, WalletHub looked at both internal and external factors in the form of different metrics in three categories:\n\n- Emotional \u0026 Physical Well-Being\n- Work Environment\n- Community \u0026 Environment\n\nThe categories are broken down into 31 metrics. These metrics include the number of work hours, job security, adult depression, income growth, and the weather, among others. Each metric is given a different weight and is graded on a scale from zero to 100, with 100 corresponding with maximum happiness. Each stateâs weighted average across all metrics was determined to calculate its overall score. The resulting ranks created [WalletHub's Happiest States in America](https://wallethub.com/edu/happiest-states/6959/).\n\n## Ten Happiest States in the U.S.\n\n#### 1. Hawaii\n\nAt the top of the list is Hawaii, which ranked first overall and first for emotional \u0026 physical well-being.

Utah\n\nUtah is the second-happiest state in the United States. Utah ranks first for work environment and second for community \u0026 environment. Utah residents not only are hard workers and enjoy their work more than residents of any other state, but they also work the fewest hours. Utah also has the highest volunteer rate, the lowest divorce rate, and is the fourth-safest state. Like residents of Hawaii, Utah residents enjoy a very active, outdoor lifestyles, keeping them mentally and physically healthy.\n\n#### 3. Minnesota \n\nMinnesota is the third-happiest state in the U.S. Minnesota ranks third for emotional and physical well-being and sixth for work environment. Minnesota is the safest state in the country, has the third-lowest divorce rate, and the second-highest volunteer rate. Minnesota residents are known for being some of the friendliest and most-inclusive people in the country, despite having some of the most intense winters in the country.\n\n#### 4.

California ranks fourth overall for emotional \u0026 physical well-being with the third-highest sports participation rate and the fifth-lowest suicide rate. Californians also have the fifth-fewest work hours. Weather is a big factor for Californiaâs happiness as many parts experience mild weather year-round. A separate study by WalletHub that ranked the ten happiest cities included eight California cities in the top ten. \n\n#### 5. New Jersey\n\nNew Jersey is the fifth-happiest state in the U.S. New Jersey ranks second for emotional \u0026 physical well-being, including having the second-lowest suicide rate in the country and the fourth-lowest divorce rate. Unfortunately, New Jersey does have the second-highest long-term unemployment rate. \n\n#### 6. Idaho\n\nThe sixth-happiest state in the United States is Idaho. Idaho ranks first for community \u0026 environment and second for work environment. Idaho residents have the sixth-best adequate sleep rate, which is an easy way to ensure a better mood. Idaho also has the 11th-lowest percent of depressed adults, the 13th-highest volunteer rate, and the 14th-lowest separation and divorce rate. \n\n#### 7. Massachusetts\n\nMassachusetts is the seventh-happiest state in the U.S. Massachusetts ranks third for work environment and eighth for emotional and physical well-being. Massachusetts has the third-lowest rate of suicide and ranks fourth for the fewest work hours.

requiring bike or motorcycle riders to wear helmets. This causes a mix of legislation regarding helmets across all 50 states. Whether or not it is a law to wear a helmet when riding, doing so is always a good idea.\r\n\r\nStudies show that wearing a helmet can reduce oneâs risk of serious brain injury or death. During a collision or fall, a proper helmet absorbs the impact energy, protecting the head and brain. Head trauma can lead to permanent cognitive and behavioral problems such as sleep disorders, trouble concentrating, memory loss and disability.\r\n\r\nMotorcycle helmet laws can be categorized four ways: required for everyone, required for everyone under 21, required for anyone under 18, and not required. Currently, only 19 states and Washington D.C. have universal helmet laws. \r\n\r\nIn California, for example, the law requires all motorcyclists, both drivers and passengers, of any age to wear a helmet at all times when riding. Safety helmets must comply with federal safety standards. Failure to wear a helmet can result in either an equipment violation with a $10 fine or a greater penalty at the discretion of the law enforcement officer.\r\n\r\nPenalties vary from state to state depending on state laws. \r\n\r\nThe following states have a universal helmet law:\r\n\r\n-\tAlabama\r\n-\tCalifornia\r\n-\tGeorgia\r\n-\tLouisiana\r\n-\tMaryland\r\n-\tMassachusetts\r\n-\tMississippi\r\n-\tMissouri\r\n-\tNebraska\r\n-\tNevada\r\n-\tNew Jersey\r\n-\tNew York\r\n-\tNorth Carolina\r\n-\tOregon\r\n-\tTennessee\r\n-\tVermont\r\n-\tVirginia\r\n-\tWashington D.C.\r\n-\tWashington\r\n-\tWest Virginia\r\n\r\nThe following states require helmets for riders under 21:\r\n\r\n-\tArkansas\r\n-\tConnecticut\r\n-\tFlorida\r\n-\tKentucky\r\n-\tMichigan\r\n-\tPennsylvania\r\n-\tRhode Island\r\n-\tSouth Carolina\r\n-\tTexas\r\n-\tUtah\r\n\r\nThe following states require helmets for riders under 18:\r\n\r\n-\tAlaska\r\n-\tArizona\r\n-\tColorado (riders and passengers)\r\n-\tDelaware (under 19)\r\n-\tHawaii\r\n-\tIdaho\r\n-\tIndiana\r\n-\tKansas\r\n-\tMaine\r\n-\tMinnesota\r\n-\tMontana\r\n-\tNew Mexico\r\n-\tNorth Dakota\r\n-\tOhio\r\n-\tOklahoma\r\n-\tSouth Dakota\r\n-\tWisconsin\r\n-\tWyoming\r\n\r\nThe following states have no law regarding helmets:\r\n\r\n-\tIllinois\r\n-\tIowa\r\n-\tNew Hampshire\r\n\r\n\r\n","data":{"states":[],"customMeta":{"columns":["state",{"header":"Helmets Required","field":"helmetLaw","columnWidth":140},{"header":"Note","field":"note"},"population"],"sortField":"State","sortAsc":true,"showAllStates":true,"relatedArticles":["abortion-laws-by-state","blue-laws-by-state","child-discipline-laws-by-state","clothing-laws-by-state","common-law-marriage-states","filial-responsibility-laws-by-state","final-paycheck-laws-by-state","gun-laws-by-state","helmet-law-states","homeschool-laws-by-state","incest-laws-by-state","late-fee-laws-by-state","magazine-capacity-laws-by-state","marijuana-laws-by-state","mushroom-laws-by-state","pepper-spray-laws-by-state","seat-belt-laws-by-state","states-with-stand-your-ground-laws","tiny-house-laws-by-state","voter-id-laws-by-state"]},"customData":[{"helmetLaw":"All Riders","note":"","state":"Alabama"},{"helmetLaw":"Age Requirement","note":"Persons 18 years of age or older \"may not\" be required to wear a helmet when operating a motorcycle in Alaska as long as that person is licensed to operate a motorcycle.","state":"Alaska"},{"helmetLaw":"Age Requirement","note":"Only those motorcycle operators and riders under 18 must wear a helmet.","state":"Arizona"},{"helmetLaw":"Age Requirement","note":"Arkansas law requires motorcycle operators and passengers under 21 to wear a helmet.","state":"Arkansas"},{"helmetLaw":"All Riders","note":"","state":"California"},{"helmetLaw":"Age Requirement","note":"All operators and passengers under 18 years of age must wear helmets.","state":"Colorado"},{"helmetLaw":"Age Requirement","note":"In Connecticut, no one under 18 is permitted to operate or ride on a motorcycle without wearing a helmet.

Americans are most familiar with three types of taxes: income tax, sales tax, and property tax.\n\n#### Income Tax\nFor many people in the United States, April 15 â or tax day â is one of the most dreaded says of the year. In addition to paying federal taxes, many people around the nation also have to pay state income taxes. \n \nWhile some states including Florida and New Hampshire are fortunate enough to not have state income taxes, there are other states that have a high state income tax rate. However, donât think that the states without income taxes get off that easy â revenue is raised for the state through other forms of taxation, including property taxes and sales taxes. \n \nOf the 50 U.S. states, a total of 43 have individual income taxes. Income from wages and salaries are taxes in 41 of the states, while just two tax income from interest and tax dividends. Seven states do not have an income tax. \n \nJust nine of the states in the U.S. use a single-rate tax structure. This means that everyone pays one rate, regardless of the amount of taxable income. Thirty-two states use graduated-rate income brackets, wherein rates are set based on the amount of taxable income and other factors including marital status at the time of filing. \n \nOf all the states, California has the highest individual income tax rates. Rates range from 1% to 13.30% based on income. Hawaii also has a high individual income tax rate, ranging from 1.4% to 11% and spread across 12 different income brackets\n \nNew Jersey doesnât fall far behind Hawaii with rates starting at 5.35% and ranging to 9.85%. Iowaâs tax rate for anyone making at least $73,710 is fairly high at 8.53%. The minimum tax rate in this state is just 0.33%. \n \nIn the states that do not use income brackets, North Carolina has the highest tax rate. This state has a single-rate tax structure of 5.25%, surpassing other states including New Hampshire (5%), Massachusetts (5.05%), and Kentucky (5%). \n\n#### Sales Tax\nA sales tax is a consumption tax imposed by the government on the sales of certain goods and services. A conventional sales tax is levied at the point of sales and collected by the retailer, who then passes it on to the government. A [use tax](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/use-tax.asp) is a sales tax on purchases made outside of oneâs state of residence for taxable items that will be used, stored, or consumed in oneâs state of residence.  \n\nState sales taxes range from 0.00% to 7.25%, with most states falling between 4% and 7%. In addition to state sales tax, some local jurisdictions also impose a local sales tax. \n\nFive states have sales tax rates of 0.00%: Alaska, Delaware, Montana, New Hampshire, and Oregon.  \n\nCalifornia levies the highest state sales tax of any state of 7.25%. In addition to this, the average local sales tax is 1.31%, equaling a combined rate of 8.56%. Tennessee has the second-highest state sales tax rate of 7.00% and has an average local sales tax rate of 2.47%, resulting in a combined rate of 9.47%. Rhode Island, Mississippi, and Indiana also have a state sales tax rate of 7.00%. \n\n#### Property Tax\nIn addition to income tax and sales tax, United States residents also pay property taxes. Property tax is a real estate ad-valorem tax levied by the jurisdiction in which the property is located and paid for by the property owner. Property taxes are recalculated annually and determined by multiplying the property tax rate by the current market value of the property.\n\nUnfortunately, every state has property taxes; however, some states have very low property tax rates. In these states, there may be higher costs elsewhere, such as high sales taxes, in order to make up for the costs. \n\nThere are 26 states with property tax rates below 1.00%. Hawaii has the lowest property tax rate among states of 0.27%; however, due to high median home costs in Hawaii, residents can still expect to pay high taxes. Alabama has the second-lowest property tax rate with 0.42%, coupled with some of the lowest home prices in the country. Louisiana follows with the third-lowest rate at 0.52%. \n\nOn the other end, New Jersey has the highest property tax rate in the United States at 2.44%. One reason for this is that New Jerseyâs county and municipal governments cannot impose local income or sales tax, so property taxes pay for almost everything in New Jersey. Illinois has the second-highest property tax rate in the U.S. at 2.31% followed by New Hampshire at 2.20%. \n","data":{"states":["California","Hawaii","New Jersey"],"customMeta":{"note":"* Rank based on normalized and combined rates for single filers with no dependents or deductions.

HIV is spread through body fluids such as blood. If HIV goes untreated and advances, it can lead to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome or AIDS.\r\n\r\nUnlike most other viruses, when a person contracts HIV, they have it for life because the human body cannot fight off the virus entirely. HIV, however, can be controlled and its progression can be slowed significantly. There are three stages of HIV:\r\n\r\n1. Acute HIV infection\r\n2. Clinical latency (HIV inactivity or dormancy)\r\n3. AIDS\r\n\r\n## HIV Around the World\r\nAccording to the [World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/hiv/data/en/), there are about 37.9 million people in the world living with HIV in 2018. The prevalence of HIV in adults ages 15 to 29 is estimated at about 0.8% of the worldâs population. \r\n\r\nHIV is believed to have come from a type of chimpanzee in Central Africa, where the chimpanzee version of the virus, simian immunodeficiency virus or SIV, was transmitted to humans when they hunted the animal and came into contact with the blood. Once the virus was transmitted to humans, it mutated into HIV. It is believed that HIV was first transmitted in the 1800s and spread slowly across Africa and later into the rest of the world, reaching the United States around the mid to late 1970s. Unfortunately, because it is the origin of HIV, Africa has the highest prevalence of the virus at an estimated 3.9%. \r\n\r\n## HIV Treatment\r\nAlthough HIV cannot be cured, it can be controlled and treated through viral load suppression, also known as antiretroviral therapy (ART). ART reduces the viral load (amount of the virus) in the bodyâs blood and fluids. ART can not only slow the progression of HIV but also reduces the chances of transmitting the virus to other people. \r\n\r\nART is recommended for all people diagnosed with HIV and should be started as soon as possible after diagnosis. \r\n\r\nOf the 37.9 million people living with HIV around the world, 23.3 million are receiving ART, which means about 62% of those diagnosed with HIV are controlling their virus. While accessibility to testing and treatment has significantly improved around the world, poverty, gender equality, and HIV stigma and discrimination are major barriers to HIV prevention and treatment in many countries. \r\n\r\n[UNAIDS](https://www.unaids.org/en), the Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS, is the worldâs leading advocate for the comprehensive and coordinated global action against the HIV/AIDS pandemic. In 2014, UNAIDS established the [90-90-90 goals](https://www.unaids.org/sites/default/files/media_asset/90-90-90_en.pdf), which called for countries around the world to get 90% of people living with HIV diagnosed; 90% of those diagnosed accessing treatment, and 90% of people on treatment to have suppressed viral loads by 2020. \r\n\r\n## HIV in the United States\r\nBased on the most recent information from the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)](https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/statistics/overview/ataglance.html), about 1.14 million Americans had HIV at the end of 2016. About 1 in 7 of those with the virus are unaware that they have it. \r\n\r\nIn 2018, 37,832 people received an HIV diagnosis, [according to the CDC]( https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/statistics/overview/ataglance.html). Among those, 42% were black or African American, 27% were Hispanic or Latino, and 25% were white. Also among the new diagnoses, 69% were among gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (sometimes referred to as MSM); 24% were among heterosexuals, and 7% were among people who inject drugs. \r\n\r\nIn the United States, there are five categories of laws pertaining to HIV and other STDs. As of 2018, 26 states have HIV-specific laws that criminalize behaviors that can potentially expose another person to HIV. \r\n\r\n#### States with the Highest Rates of HIV\r\nThese numbers are based on the CDCâs [HIV Surveillance Report](https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/pdf/library/reports/surveillance/cdc-hiv-surveillance-report-2018-vol-30.pdf).\r\n\r\nCalifornia has the highest number of people living with HIV of 128,153, a rate of 389.7 people with HIV per 100,000 residents. Of those living with HIV in California, the largest group is White with 48,155 people and the second-largest is Hispanic/Latino with 48,029. \r\n\r\nNew York has the second-highest number of people living with HIV of 126,495, a rate of 760.2 per 100,000. This rate is more than double that of Californiaâs. The largest group living with HIV in New York is Black/African American with 47,164 people living with the virus. \r\n\r\nFlorida has 110,034 people living with HIV, the third-highest number in the United States. Floridaâs HIV rate is 612.3 per 100,000. The group with the highest number of people living with HIV is Black/African American with 49,943. \r\n\r\nTexas has the fourth-highest number of people living with HIV in the United States of 88,099, translating to a rate of 382.9 per 100,000 people. The largest group living with the virus is Black/African American with 31,915 people, followed by Hispanic/Latino with 29,758. \r\n\r\nGeorgia has 52,528 people living with HIV, a rate of 608.8 per 100,000. This is the fifth-highest in the country. A majority of those infected with the virus are Black/African American, totaling 35,974. \r\n","data":{"customMeta":{"relatedArticles":["hospital-rankings-by-state","medicaid-enrollment-by-state","medicaid-income-limits-by-state","states-that-expanded-medicaid","abortion-laws-by-state","abortion-rates-by-state","hiv-statistics-by-state","maternal-mortality-rate-by-state","infant-mortality-rate-by-state"]}},"lastModified":"2020-04-06T20:09:05.160Z","path":"hiv-statistics-by-state","name":"Hiv Statistics By State"},{"article":"In the United States, there are over half a million people experiencing homelessness. These individuals live in a temporary shelter or transitional housing or sleep in a place not meant for habitation (like an abandoned building). \r\n \r\nOverall, 66.7 percent of the total homeless population of the United States is single individuals, with the remaining 33.3 percent being families. \r\nIn recent years, homelessness increased nationally by almost one percent. This number is comprised of unaccompanied children and young adults, single adults experiencing chronic homelessness, and people experiencing unsheltered homelessness. \r\n\r\nSome populations have seen a decrease in homelessness. Dramatic reductions are amongst families and the veteran community.\r\n\r\nThe state of California currently has the highest homeless population, with almost 25 percent of the total population experiencing some form of homelessness. This figure is attributed to issues with providing affordable and adequate housing opportunities, current drug laws, and the inaccessibility of important mental health resources. \r\n\r\nAnother alarming statistic comes from New York City. In recent years, homelessness in this city reached the highest levels since the Great Depression in the 1930s, reaching its highest point under Mayor Bill de Blasio. This year, however, saw the second year in the decline of the homeless or unsheltered population, attributed to the creation of safe havens, or specialized shelters, that have a streamlined process of getting people into permanent housing. \r\n\r\nThe state with the lowest percentage of homeless population is experiencing an increase as well. Due to an oil and gas boom, North Dakota now has the fastest-growing economy. With this comes a rush of people coming to the state for work, but surging housing prices has made it difficult to find a home. \r\n\r\nFor a state-by-state look at homeless statistics, take a look at the table below.

A homestead exemption can block the forced sale of a primary residence and provide tax relief for surviving spouses. Homestead exemptions are only for one primary residence and no other exemption can be claimed on any other property anywhere. \r\n\r\nHomestead exemption is a great option for those facing financial hardship, such as people filing for bankruptcy or widow or widower facing higher bills than he or she can no longer afford to pay due to the passing of a spouse. \r\n\r\nHomestead exemptions can protect a home up to a certain value of the homeownerâs equity in it. If the homesteadâs equity exceeds the limit of the exemption in that state, creditors may force the debtors to sell. In this case, the debtors would receive the monetary amount of the bankruptcy exemption. \r\n\r\nTax reductions under homestead exemptions are usually a fixed discount on taxes. For example, a home valued at $150,000 using a $50,000 homestead exemption will be taxed on $100,000 of assessed value.\r\n\r\nHomestead exemptions vary by state, including how it is applied and how much protection it offers against creditors. The exemption is an automatic benefit in some states and a claim must be filed in others. New Jersey and Pennsylvania have no homestead exemptions.\r\n\r\nThe current federal bankruptcy exemption amount as of 2019 is $25,510. While most states require homeowners to use the stateâs limit, some will allow the homeowner to use either the federal or the state.\r\n\r\nBelow is a table with each stateâs homestead exemption

Human trafficking is a serious crime and violation of human rights, involving the use of force, coercion or fraud to exploit a person into slave labor or sexual exploitation.\r\n\r\nHuman trafficking can happen to people of all ages and genders, and of any race or religious background.  Victims frequently do not seek help due to language barriers, fear of their traffickers or fear of law enforcement. Because human trafficking is considered to be a hidden crime, several key indicators can help people recognize potential endangerment and notify law enforcement.\r\nA common misconception about human trafficking is that it does not happen in the United States. This is false, as the United States is ranked as one of the worst countries in the world for human trafficking. It is estimated that 199,000 incidents occur within the United States every year.\r\n\r\nThe [National Human Trafficking Hotline](https://humantraffickinghotline.org/states)\r\nhas one of the most extensive data sets on human trafficking in the United States collected through phone calls, texts, online chats, emails, and online tips received by the hotline. While this information is some of the most comprehensive available, the data does not define the totality of human trafficking. The number of cases presented is only the cases that are reported. \r\n\r\nThe [Human Trafficking Hotline](https://humantraffickinghotline.org/) serves victims and survivors of human trafficking across the United States. The Hotline is available 24/7, 365 days a year, and in more than 200 languages.

In 2019, there were 34 human trafficking cases reported in D.C., 18 of which were sex trafficking, 7 of which were labor trafficking, 7 were unspecified and 3 were sex and labor trafficking. \r\n\r\nNevada has the second-highest human trafficking rate of 9.97 victims per 100,000 people. Nevada has 124 reported human trafficking cases in 2019, 100 of which were sex trafficking cases. Because adult prostitution is legal in 11 counties in Nevada, traffickers use legal brothels to traffic children by creating false identification. \r\nDelaware has the third-highest human trafficking rate of 4.27 victims per 100,000 people. Delaware has 14 cases reported in 2019, 10 of which were sex trafficking. Females were the majority of victims in the cases. Delaware is a popular state for traffickers due to its location on I-95.\r\n\r\nWith a human trafficking rate of 4.2 victims per 100,000 people, Nebraska has the fourth-highest human trafficking rate in the United States. Nebraska had 25 reported cases in 2019, the majority of which were sex trafficking cases. Females were the primary target of sex trafficking, mostly adults but some minors were involved as well. Some of the main centers of trafficking in Nebraska are Omaha, Lincoln, and Grand Island. \r\n\r\nCalifornia has the fifth-highest rate of human trafficking of 4.15 victims per 100,000 residents. California has the highest number of human trafficking cases reported of 749 cases in 2019. Given Californiaâs location by an international border and presence of major airports, traffickers see the state as a low-risk, high-reward, and profitable human trafficking location. Of the 749 cases reported, 535 were sex trafficking, 85 were labor trafficking, 81 were unspecified, and 48 were sex and labor trafficking. \r\n\r\nMichigan has the sixth-highest human trafficking rate of 3.81 victims per 100,000 people. Michigan has the seventh-highest number of sex trafficking cases reported in 2019 of 172. Of the 172 cases, 131 of them were sex trafficking, 16 were unspecified, 15 were labor trafficking, and 10 were sex and labor. The top industries for labor trafficking in Michigan were restaurants and foodservice and traveling sales crew and the top industries for sex trafficking were residence-based commercial sex and hotel- and motel-based. \r\n\r\nGeorgia has the seventh-highest human trafficking rate of 3.49 victims per 100,000 residents. Georgia has the fifth-highest number of human trafficking cases of 222 in 2019. Atlanta, in particular, is a major human trafficking transportation hub and is one of the top U.S. cities with the highest levels of child sex trafficking. Of the 222 cases in 2019, 159 were sex trafficking, 41 were labor trafficking, 13 were sex and labor, and nine were unspecified. About 57 cases were confirmed to involved minors. \r\n\r\nHawaii has the eighth-highest human trafficking rate in the United States of 3.4 victims per 100,000 people. In 2019, Hawaii had 21 reported human trafficking cases. [A study](https://www.dropbox.com/s/e9muqfigatvfdp1/2020_SexTraffickingHawaii_FINAL.pdf?dl=0) published interviewed sex trafficking victims in Hawaii. The study revealed that more than 75% of trafficked victims reported being homeless, 64% of victims were Native Hawaiian, and 82% of victims were first trafficked as children.\r\n\r\nNew Mexico has the ninth-highest human trafficking rate in the U.S. of 3.34 cases per 100,000 people. There were 31 reported human trafficking cases in 2019 in New Mexico. The majority of human trafficking cases are sex trafficking, with most of the victims being female. New Mexico is a prime location for human trafficking because the interstate exchange of I-25 and I-40 called the Big I. New Mexico is also attractive to traffickers because of its high rates of poverty and domestic violence.\r\n\r\nWith a human trafficking rate of 3.26 victims per 100,000 people, Kansas has the tenth-highest rate in the country. There were 43 reported cases in 2019. The majority of cases were sex trafficking and the majority of victims were female. Cities and counties along the I-70 corridor in Kansas experience a high-than-average amount of trafficking. \r\n\r\n","data":{"states":[],"customMeta":{"columns":["state",{"header":"Rate (per 100K)","field":"per100K"},{"header":"Human Trafficking Cases","field":"reportedTraffickingCases"}],"sortField":"per100K","showAllStates":true,"sortAsc":false,"tileMap":{"field":"per100K"},"scatterChartFields":[{"field":"per100K","title":"Rate","label":"Rate per 100K"}],"relatedArticles":["death-penalty-states","gun-deaths-by-state","gun-deaths-per-capita-by-state","murder-rate-by-state","executions-by-state","mass-shootings-by-state","school-shootings-by-state","crime-rate-by-state","gun-violence-by-state","prison-population-by-state","human-trafficking-statistics-by-state","most-dangerous-states"]},"customData":[{"reportedTraffickingCases":149,"state":"Louisiana","per100K":3.21},{"reportedTraffickingCases":142,"state":"Indiana","per100K":2.11},{"reportedTraffickingCases":141,"state":"Kentucky","per100K":3.13},{"reportedTraffickingCases":135,"state":"Oregon","per100K":3.14},{"reportedTraffickingCases":178,"state":"Missouri","per100K":2.89},{"reportedTraffickingCases":178,"state":"Colorado","per100K":3.05},{"reportedTraffickingCases":165,"state":"Tennessee","per100K":2.39},{"reportedTraffickingCases":165,"state":"Maryland","per100K":2.71},{"reportedTraffickingCases":156,"state":"South Carolina","per100K":2.99},{"reportedTraffickingCases":275,"state":"Pennsylvania","per100K":2.14},{"reportedTraffickingCases":231,"state":"Arizona","per100K":3.13},{"reportedTraffickingCases":229,"state":"Washington","per100K":2.94},{"reportedTraffickingCases":224,"state":"New Jersey","per100K":2.51},{"reportedTraffickingCases":198,"state":"Virginia","per100K":2.3},{"reportedTraffickingCases":383,"state":"Michigan","per100K":3.81},{"reportedTraffickingCases":375,"state":"Georgia","per100K":3.49},{"reportedTraffickingCases":313,"state":"Nevada","per100K":9.97},{"reportedTraffickingCases":296,"state":"Illinois","per100K":2.34},{"reportedTraffickingCases":287,"state":"North Carolina","per100K":2.7},{"reportedTraffickingCases":1656,"state":"California","per100K":4.15},{"reportedTraffickingCases":134,"state":"Wisconsin","per100K":2.29},{"reportedTraffickingCases":121,"state":"Oklahoma","per100K":3.06},{"reportedTraffickingCases":120,"state":"Massachusetts","per100K":1.72},{"reportedTraffickingCases":120,"state":"Minnesota","per100K":2.11},{"reportedTraffickingCases":102,"state":"Iowa","per100K":3.21},{"reportedTraffickingCases":95,"state":"Kansas","per100K":3.26},{"reportedTraffickingCases":89,"state":"Alabama","per100K":1.81},{"reportedTraffickingCases":86,"state":"Mississippi","per100K":2.88},{"reportedTraffickingCases":85,"state":"Arkansas","per100K":2.8},{"reportedTraffickingCases":84,"state":"District of Columbia","per100K":11.66},{"reportedTraffickingCases":82,"state":"Nebraska","per100K":4.2},{"reportedTraffickingCases":76,"state":"Utah","per100K":2.32},{"reportedTraffickingCases":70,"state":"New Mexico","per100K":3.34},{"reportedTraffickingCases":55,"state":"Connecticut","per100K":1.54},{"reportedTraffickingCases":48,"state":"Hawaii","per100K":3.4},{"reportedTraffickingCases":42,"state":"Delaware","per100K":4.27},{"reportedTraffickingCases":40,"state":"West Virginia","per100K":2.25},{"reportedTraffickingCases":32,"state":"Maine","per100K":2.38},{"reportedTraffickingCases":26,"state":"Idaho","per100K":1.42},{"reportedTraffickingCases":561,"state":"Texas","per100K":1.9},{"reportedTraffickingCases":229,"state":"Ohio","per100K":1.95},{"reportedTraffickingCases":466,"state":"Florida","per100K":2.12},{"reportedTraffickingCases":200,"state":"New York","per100K":1.03},{"reportedTraffickingCases":22,"state":"South Dakota","per100K":2.44},{"reportedTraffickingCases":22,"state":"Montana","per100K":2.02},{"reportedTraffickingCases":19,"state":"Alaska","per100K":2.59},{"reportedTraffickingCases":18,"state":"Rhode Island","per100K":1.7},{"reportedTraffickingCases":14,"state":"North Dakota","per100K":1.84},{"reportedTraffickingCases":14,"state":"Puerto Rico","per100K":0.46},{"reportedTraffickingCases":13,"state":"Vermont","per100K":2.07},{"reportedTraffickingCases":12,"state":"Wyoming","per100K":2.12},{"reportedTraffickingCases":11,"state":"New Hampshire","per100K":0.8}]},"lastModified":"2020-04-06T20:09:05.160Z","path":"human-trafficking-statistics-by-state","name":"Human Trafficking Statistics By State"},{"article":"Incest is defined as a sexual relationship between two closely related family members.

Income inequality refers to the extent to which income is distributed unevenly among a population. \r\n\r\nThe [Gini coefficient](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gini-index.asp), also called the Gini Index or Gini ratio, is a statistical measure of distribution intended to represent the income or wealth distribution of a nation. It ranges from 0 (0%) to 1 (100%), with 0 representing perfect equality and 1 representing perfect inequality. A higher Gini coefficient means greater inequality. The Gini coefficient would be zero is everyone in a nation had the same income. \r\n\r\nThe Gini coefficient is defined based on the [Lorenz curve](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lorenz-curve.asp). The Lorenz curve plots the percentiles of the population on the horizontal axis of the graph according to income or wealth, whichever is being measured (income, in this case). The cumulative income of the population is plotted on the vertical axis.\r\n\r\nThe United States has a Gini coefficient of 0.485, the highest it has been in 50 years, according to the United States Census Bureau. Each state also has a Gini coefficient. \r\n\r\n[Zippia](https://www.zippia.com/advice/states-highest-lowest-income-inequality/) analyzed datasets from 2010 and 2016 from the American Community Survey and then analyzed the Gini coefficient for each state in both periods. Based on this, the five states with the highest income inequality in the United States are:\r\n\r\n1.\tNew York (.5102)\r\n2.\tConnecticut (.4947)\r\n3.\tLouisiana (.4903)\r\n4.\tCalifornia (.4880)\r\n5.\tFlorida (.4852)\r\n\r\nAll five of these states have a Gini coefficient that is higher than the U.S. Gini coefficient. \r\n\r\nNew York has the greatest income inequality in the United States. In 2015, the average income of the top 1% was $2.2 million and the average income of the bottom 99% was $49,617. This is a ratio of 44.4 to 1. Nationally, the numbers were $1.32 million for the top 1% and $50,107 for the bottom 99%, a ratio of 26.3 to 1. \r\n\r\nThe five states with the least income inequality are:\r\n\r\n1.\tAlaska (.4174)\r\n2.\tUtah (.4261)\r\n3.\tWyoming (.4279)\r\n4.\tNew Hampshire (.4344)\r\n5.\tHawaii (.4369)\r\n\r\nDespite these states being the least unequal in the U.S., their Gini coefficients are still higher than many countries around the world. Alaska is about as unequal as Russia. \r\n\r\nMontana, California, Rhode Island, and Maine are experiencing the fastest changes in income inequality in the U.S. From 2010 to 2016, Montanaâs Gini coefficient increased by .022, Californiaâs increased by .019, and both Rhode Islandâs and Maineâs increased by .018.\r\n\r\nIncome inequality has both economic and political impacts such as slower GDP growth, reduced income mobility, greater household debt, political polarization, and higher poverty rates. Crime has been shown to be correlated with inequality. The separation of society into the âelitesâ and the âmassesâ played a central role in the collapse of other advanced civilizations such as the Roman Empire. \r\n\r\nThe income inequailty of each state can be found on [Zippia](https://www.zippia.com/advice/states-highest-lowest-income-inequality/).\r\n","data":{"customMeta":{"relatedArticles":[{"link":"gdp-by-state","title":"GDP by State"},"gdp-growth-by-state",{"link":"richest-states-in-usa","title":"Richest States"},"poorest-states","per-capita-income-by-state","income-inequality-by-state","income-tax-by-state"]}},"lastModified":"2020-04-06T20:09:05.160Z","path":"income-inequality-by-state","name":"Income Inequality By State"},{"article":"In the United States, each state has its own policy for collecting income taxes. Incomes taxes are just one of the ways that state governments make revenues for operations â think things like building schools and repairing roads. Of the 50 states, a total of 43 have some form of state income taxes. In 41 states, wages and salaries are taxed. In New Hampshire and Tennessee, only interest income and tax dividends are taxed. In the remaining seven states, there is no state income tax. However, the state makes revenue through other forms of taxation, such as higher property tax rates or higher sales tax rates. \n\nThese arenât the only differences among the states when it comes to income taxes, either. For example, some states have their own deductions and exemptions, while others use rates based on the federal tax code, while some states donât allow any deductions or exemptions. Some states have different brackets for married and single tax filers. \n\nFor the purpose of this article, weâre going to take a look at the latest marginal individual income tax rates as of 2019. Remember, though, this data is subject to change over time but is accurate as of August 2019. \n\nThe state with the highest income tax bracket is California, which has a maximum tax rate of 13.3%. The lowest tax bracket in California is 1%, which is one of the lowest in the nation. The next highest income tax rate is found in Oregon, where the highest bracket has a rate of 9.9%. The lowest income tax bracket in Oregon is 5%. Minnesota has a similar range of state income tax rates, with the lowest being 5.35% and the highest reaching 9.85%. \n\nOther states with income tax rates that exceed 8% include Iowa, New Jersey, Vermont, Washington D.C., New York, and Hawaii. \n\nStates with maximum state income tax rates of at least 6% but less than 7% include Connecticut, Arkansas, Montana, Nebraska, Delaware, West Virginia, Georgia, Missouri, Kentucky, and Louisiana. \n\nStates with maximum income tax rates of at least 5% but less than 6% are Rhode Island, Maryland, Virginia, Kansas, Ohio, Oklahoma, Alabama, and Mississippi. \n\nOther than the states that do not levy an individual income tax, North Dakota has the lowest income tax rate in the nation. The tax rates in this state fall between 1.1% and 2.9%. Arizona has the second-lowest rates at 2.59% to 4.54%.

The figure is used as a measure of economic expansion and an indicator for national economic health, as higher job growth numbers indicate increasing economic growth and a strengthening job market.\r\n\r\nJob growth is reported each month as part of the Bureau of Labor Statisticsâ Employment Situation Summary. The BLS sends out a survey each month and compiles and publishes the results. The job growth figure is expressed as the gross number of jobs created in the United States in the previous month. \r\n\r\nThe minimum level of job growth needed to mitigate the effects of new people entering the workforce is between 100,000 and 150,000 new jobs per month. It is believed that these are the minimum required numbers to have a positive, sustainable impact; however, consistently high job growth figures are believed to be indicative of rising interest rates and inflation. \r\n\r\nIn September 2019, the United States saw 136,000 new jobs added to its economy, fewer than the 168,000 in August. It was reported that 11,400 retail and 2,000 manufacturing jobs were lost in September, both losses possibly attributed to the trade war with China hurting industries that depend on exports and imports. Despite this data, the United States economy is doing well in other aspects, such as an unemployment rate of 3.5% - the lowest it has been since December 1969.\r\n\r\nBecause different states have drastically different populations and are home to different industries, their job growth rates vary greatly. The states that saw the highest job growth percent increase are:\r\n\r\n1.\tUtah (3.10%)\r\n2.\tNevada (3.10%)\r\n3.\tWashington (3.00%)\r\n4.\tIdaho (2.80%)\r\n5.\tTexas (2.60%)\r\n6.\tFlorida (2.60%)\r\n7.\tArizona (2.50%)\r\n8.\tNew Mexico (2.40%)\r\n9.\tSouth Dakota (2.10%)\r\n10.\tAlabama (2.00%)\r\n\r\nUtah and Nevada have the highest job growth percentage at 3.10%. Utah sees approximately 47,400 jobs increase in a year and Nevada sees 43,400. Both states saw a job growth rate more than double the national rate of 1.5%, and Utah boasts a lower unemployment rate of 2.8% (Nevadaâs is currently 4.1%).  \r\n\r\nWhile many states experience significant job growth, there are some states with much lower rates or some that didnât grow at all. The states with the lowest job growth rates are:\r\n\r\n1.\tLouisiana (-0.10%)\r\n2.\tMinnesota (0.00%)\r\n3.\tMaryland (0.10%)\r\n4.\tConnecticut (0.20%)\r\n5.\tNorth Dakota (0.20%)\r\n6.\tMichigan (0.40%)\r\n7.\tDelaware (0.50%)\r\n8.\tNebraska (0.50%)\r\n9.\tOhio (0.50%)\r\n10.\tPennsylvania (0.50%)\r\n11.\tWisconsin (0.50%)\r\n\r\nAs seen in the data, Louisiana had a negative job growth rate of -0.10%, a loss of approximately 1,000 jobs. Minnesota had a nearly 0.00% job growth rate, adding only 800 jobs over 12 months. Luckily, both states unemployment ratesâ are not particularly high, with Louisianaâs at 4.4% and Minnesotaâs at 3.4%, which is just below the national unemployment rate.\r\n\r\nCertain states see more job growth than others, and the same applies to industries. The highest employment change is seen in the Education and health services industries, followed by professional and business services, hospitality, and government. Some sectors have also seen a decrease in jobs, such as retail trade, manufacturing, and utilities. \r\n\r\nBelow is a table of each stateâs job growth.

The element symbol for gold is Au, and it has atomic number 79 on the periodic table. Gold has many uses, thanks to its ductility and malleability, such as being used in electronics, dentistry, radiation shielding, and wiring. Additionally, it can also be eaten in foods or drinks, despite being a heavy, dense metal.  \r\n\r\nGold has monetary and symbolic value. Pure elemental gold is 24 karat, 75% pure gold is 18 karat, 58% pure gold is 14 karat, and 41.7% pure gold is 10 karat. The content of pure gold is typically used to determine the value of jewelry. The United States once used the gold standard, which a monetary system where a countryâs currency or paper money has a value directly linked to gold. This, however, was abandoned in 1933. \r\n\r\nIt is believed that gold mining has been done for almost 7,000 years and that the Egyptians were the first to smelt gold around 3,600 B.C. Years later, hold jewelry appeared. Throughout history, gold has been of great value to humans, inspiring gold rushes and leading to wars. \r\n\r\nAs of November 2019, gold is valued at $1,500 per ounce. Jewelry accounts for about half of gold demand, while the rest is from investment demand and industrial uses. During times of recession or economic uncertainty, investors often turn to investing in gold because of its enduring value, protecting against currency devaluation or inflation.  Gold also receives demand from [exchange traded funds](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/etf.asp) (ETFs), which hold the gold and issue shares that investors can buy and sell. \r\n\r\nGold production remains vital around the world. The worldâs gold production affects the price of gold based on the law of supply and demand. The largest gold-producing countries in the world are:\r\n\r\n1.\tChina (399.7 tonnes)\r\n2.\tAustralia (312.2 tonnes)\r\n3.\tRussia (281.5 tonnes)\r\n4.\tUnited States (253.2 tonnes)\r\n5.\tCanada (193.0 tonnes)\r\n6.\tIndonesia (190.0 tonnes)\r\n7.\tPeru (155.4 tonnes)\r\n8.\tSouth Africa (123.5 tonnes)\r\n9.\tMexico (121.6 tonnes)\r\n10.\tGhana (101.8 tonnes)\r\n\r\nChina is currently the worldâs largest producer of gold, producing 399.7 tonnes of gold in 2018 and accounting for 12% of the global mine production. China is experiencing a downtrend in production, with 2018âs production being 6% less than in 2017. This is due to the governmentâs tighter environmental policies. \r\n\r\nWorldwide, the increase in gold has slowed since 2016, due in part to the fact that the âeasy gold,â or easily accessible gold, is has already been mined. Gold is now more challenging to mine, which raises additional problems such as miner safety and environment impacts. \r\n","lastModified":"2020-04-06T20:09:05.160Z","path":"largest-landowners-by-state","name":"Largest Landowners By State"},{"article":"Landlords and tenants set forth agreed-upon terms when signing a lease or rental agreement. In order to protect the landlord and assure that the tenant pays their rent on time, the landlord will typically include a late fee in the lease or rental agreement. A late fee must be explicitly stated in the agreement in order for it to be legally forced upon the tenant. \r\n\r\nThe timeframes to charge late fees vary but are typically when rent is three (3) or more days late and then increased late fees are applied when rent is 10 or more days late. Reasonable late fees are typically no more than 5% of the total rent when rent is three or more days late and may be increased to, but should not exceed, 10% of the rent when rent is 10 or more days late. \r\n\r\nMost states do not specifically address late fees written in law. For those states that do not have specific laws regarding late fees, it is best to follow the aforementioned guidelines. Twenty-eight states do not have laws regarding late fees and 22 states and the District of Columbia do have laws regarding late fees.\r\n\r\n## Late Fee Laws by State\r\n#### Arizona\r\nLate fees must be outlined in a written lease or rental agreement and must be reasonable. \r\n\r\n#### California\r\nLate fees will only be enforced if the landlord includes specified language in a written lease or rental agreement. The late fee must be a reasonable estimation of how much the late rent costs the landlord.\r\n\r\n#### Connecticut\r\nLate fees cannot be applied until after the rent is nine (9) days late. \r\n\r\n#### Delaware\r\nLate fees cannot be more than 5% of the rent and cannot be imposed until after the rent is five (5) days. The landlord must maintain an office in the county where the rental unit is located here tenants can pay rent in order to charge a late fee. If the landlord does not have an office in the same county, the tenant has three extra days to pay rent before the landlord can charge a late fee. \r\n\r\n#### District of Columbia\r\nThe lease or rental agreement must have specified language regarding late fees. Late fees cannot be more than 5% of the rent and cannot be imposed until after the rent is at least five (5) days late. The tenant cannot be evicted for failure to pay late fees. The landlord can deduct unpaid fees from the security deposit at the end of the tenancy. \r\n\r\n#### Georgia\r\nGeorgia does not have any specific statutes regarding late fees; however, Georgia law states that all contracts for rent bear interest from the time rent is due. \r\n\r\n#### Iowa\r\nWhen rent is $700 or less per month, late fees cannot exceed $12 per day or a total amount of $60 per month. When rent is over $700 per month, late fees cannot exceed $20 per day or a total amount of $100 per month.\r\n\r\n#### Maine\r\nLate fees cannot exceed 4% of the amount due for 30 days. Notification of late fees must be given to tenants in writing at the beginning of the tenancy.

The survey reported that 23.0% said they were Catholic and 22.5% were evangelicals. All three numbers are within the margin of error with one another, making the results a three-way tie. \r\n\r\nPeople who have âno religionâ are a group comprised of atheists, agnostics, the spiritual, and those who have no specific organized religion. Many believe that millennials are driving the trend and that the âno religionâ group will be the largest within the next four to six years.\r\n\r\nThe shift away from any one dominant religious group is seen as beneficial for a secular society with a government built on the idea of separation of church and state.\r\n\r\nThe least religious states are Massachusetts and New Hampshire, both of which have only 33% of adults identifying themselves as âhighly religious.â In Boston, Massachusetts, new belief systems and values dominate the city, shifting people away from religion. These include equality for women and LGBTQ rights, causing more people to reject patriarchal or anti-gay religions. Additionally, people are shifting their focus to higher educationâs critical thinking, scientific ways of thinking and evidence, and liberal politics for progress and social justice. \r\n\r\nThese reasons can be applied to much of the Northeast United States, where most of the least religious states are located. The ten least religious states are:\r\n\r\n1.\tMassachusetts\r\n2.\tNew Hampshire \r\n3.\tMaine\r\n4.\tVermont\r\n5.\tConnecticut\r\n6.\tWashington\r\n7.\tWisconsin\r\n8.\tAlaska\r\n9.\tNew York\r\n10.\tColorado\r\n\r\nThe most religious states in the US are located in the South. Alabama and Mississippi are the most religious states in the US, with 77% of people reporting that they are highly religious. All of the top ten most religious states in the US are located in the Bible Belt, an informal region in the southeast United States where socially conservative evangelical Protestantism and Christian church attendance are the strongest in the nation.\r\nBelow is a table of each stateâs rank from least religious to most religious and the percentage of people in each state identifying as âvery religious.â\r\n","data":{"states":[],"customMeta":{"columns":["state",{"header":"Non-Religious Rank","field":"nonReligiousRank"},{"header":"Religious Adults","field":"religiousAdults","format":"perc"},"population"],"sortField":"nonReligiousRank","sortAsc":true,"showAllStates":true,"chloroMap":{"reverseColors":true,"field":"religiousAdults"},"relatedArticles":["amish-population","bible-belt-states","jewish-population-by-state","least-religious-states","most-religious-states","muslim-population-by-state","mormon-population-by-state"]},"customData":[{"religiousAdults":0.77,"state":"Alabama","nonReligiousRank":50},{"religiousAdults":0.77,"state":"Mississippi","nonReligiousRank":50},{"religiousAdults":0.73,"state":"Tennessee","nonReligiousRank":48},{"religiousAdults":0.71,"state":"Louisiana","nonReligiousRank":47},{"religiousAdults":0.7,"state":"Arkansas","nonReligiousRank":46},{"religiousAdults":0.7,"state":"South Carolina","nonReligiousRank":46},{"religiousAdults":0.69,"state":"West Virginia","nonReligiousRank":44},{"religiousAdults":0.66,"state":"Georgia","nonReligiousRank":43},{"religiousAdults":0.66,"state":"Oklahoma","nonReligiousRank":43},{"religiousAdults":0.65,"state":"North Carolina","nonReligiousRank":41},{"religiousAdults":0.64,"state":"Texas","nonReligiousRank":40},{"religiousAdults":0.64,"state":"Utah","nonReligiousRank":40},{"religiousAdults":0.63,"state":"Kentucky","nonReligiousRank":38},{"religiousAdults":0.61,"state":"Virginia","nonReligiousRank":37},{"religiousAdults":0.6,"state":"Missouri","nonReligiousRank":36},{"religiousAdults":0.59,"state":"South Dakota","nonReligiousRank":35},{"religiousAdults":0.58,"state":"Ohio","nonReligiousRank":34},{"religiousAdults":0.57,"state":"New Mexico","nonReligiousRank":33},{"religiousAdults":0.55,"state":"Iowa","nonReligiousRank":32},{"religiousAdults":0.55,"state":"Kansas","nonReligiousRank":32},{"religiousAdults":0.55,"state":"New Jersey","nonReligiousRank":32},{"religiousAdults":0.54,"state":"Florida","nonReligiousRank":29},{"religiousAdults":0.54,"state":"Indiana","nonReligiousRank":29},{"religiousAdults":0.54,"state":"Maryland","nonReligiousRank":29},{"religiousAdults":0.54,"state":"Nebraska","nonReligiousRank":29},{"religiousAdults":0.54,"state":"Wyoming","nonReligiousRank":29},{"religiousAdults":0.53,"state":"Arizona","nonReligiousRank":24},{"religiousAdults":0.53,"state":"District of Columbia","nonReligiousRank":24},{"religiousAdults":0.53,"state":"Michigan","nonReligiousRank":24},{"religiousAdults":0.53,"state":"North Dakota","nonReligiousRank":24},{"religiousAdults":0.53,"state":"Pennsylvania","nonReligiousRank":24},{"religiousAdults":0.52,"state":"Delaware","nonReligiousRank":19},{"religiousAdults":0.51,"state":"Idaho","nonReligiousRank":18},{"religiousAdults":0.51,"state":"Illinois","nonReligiousRank":18},{"religiousAdults":0.49,"state":"California","nonReligiousRank":16},{"religiousAdults":0.49,"state":"Minnesota","nonReligiousRank":16},{"religiousAdults":0.49,"state":"Nevada","nonReligiousRank":16},{"religiousAdults":0.49,"state":"Rhode Island","nonReligiousRank":16},{"religiousAdults":0.48,"state":"Montana","nonReligiousRank":12},{"religiousAdults":0.48,"state":"Oregon","nonReligiousRank":12},{"religiousAdults":0.47,"state":"Colorado","nonReligiousRank":10},{"religiousAdults":0.47,"state":"Hawaii","nonReligiousRank":10},{"religiousAdults":0.46,"state":"New York","nonReligiousRank":8},{"religiousAdults":0.45,"state":"Alaska","nonReligiousRank":7},{"religiousAdults":0.45,"state":"Washington","nonReligiousRank":7},{"religiousAdults":0.45,"state":"Wisconsin","nonReligiousRank":7},{"religiousAdults":0.43,"state":"Connecticut","nonReligiousRank":4},{"religiousAdults":0.34,"state":"Maine","nonReligiousRank":3},{"religiousAdults":0.34,"state":"Vermont","nonReligiousRank":3},{"religiousAdults":0.33,"state":"Massachusetts","nonReligiousRank":1},{"religiousAdults":0.33,"state":"New Hampshire","nonReligiousRank":1}]},"sources":[{"name":"How religious is your state?","link":"https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/02/29/how-religious-is-your-state/?state=alabama"}],"lastModified":"2020-04-06T20:09:05.160Z","path":"least-religious-states","name":"Least Religious States"},{"article":"The âcorrectâ or âminimumâ age to let someone start babysitting is a subjective matter. Factors such as the age and maturity levels of the child or children who need care and the maturity level of the babysitter providing the care are important to consider, as well as the amount of care required by the child or children who need care. This includes the number of hours and any special care the child or children require.  \r\n\r\nMost states do not have laws specifying an age requirement for babysitting, and only some have guidelines for how old a child should be before they are left home alone. These guidelines range from six to 14 years. Below is a [list of states](http://www.imom.com/home-alone-rules-state/#.XjBFnRNKjIE) with this guideline:\r\n\r\n-\tAlabama: 12*\r\n-\tArkansas: 12*\r\n-\tColorado: 12*\r\n-\tDelaware: 12*\r\n-\tGeorgia: 9*\r\n-\tIllinois: 14\r\n-\tKansas: 6*\r\n-\tMaryland: 8\r\n-\tMichigan: 10*\r\n-\tNebraska: 7*\r\n-\tNew Hampshire: 10*\r\n-\tNorth Carolina: 8\r\n-\tNorth Dakota: 9*\r\n-\tOklahoma: 7*\r\n-\tTennessee: 10*\r\n-\tWashington: 10*\r\n\r\n*Age listed is the recommended minimum age that a child may be left home alone in place of a required/legally specified minimum age.\r\n\r\nThe rest is ultimately a judgment call of the parents of both the children needing care and the parents of the child wanting to babysit. Age, maturity level, and experience with younger children are all important factors, as well as first aid training. Babysitters need to understand safety and how to respond if an emergency arises.\r\n\r\nThe American Red Cross offers babysitting and child care courses designed to prepare those taking the course with universal skills and techniques that every babysitter should have. These courses are available online for those who prefer to learn on their own time or as an in-person class with access to highly-skilled instructors and in-class activities. These courses cover basic care for infants and children, basic first aid, child behavior, emergency protocols, leadership, and age-appropriate activities. Red Cross also offers [first aid and CPR/AED certification](https://www.redcross.org/take-a-class/cpr) courses. \r\n\r\nFurther preparation aside from formal training is also essential. Children can ask to help a friend watch a younger sibling or volunteer to be a parentâs helper for a relative or neighbor with young children. Those hiring a younger sitting should ask the sitter to arrive earlier so that they can give the sitter a tour of their home, provide emergency numbers, and explain any house rules or special needs of their children being cared for. \r\n\r\n","data":{"customMeta":{"relatedArticles":["homeschool-laws-by-state","number-of-days-in-school-year-by-state","public-school-rankings-by-state","required-school-days-by-state","what-age-to-start-kindergarten-by-state","best-states-for-education","most-educated-states","legal-babysitting-age-by-state","per-pupil-spending-by-state","sat-scores-by-state","teacher-pay-by-state","us-literacy-rates-by-state"]}},"lastModified":"2020-04-06T20:09:05.160Z","path":"legal-babysitting-age-by-state","name":"Legal Babysitting Age By State"},{"article":"In the United States, getting your driverâs license is only the first step to legally operating a vehicle.

State"},{"article":"The livable wage, also known as the living wage, is defined as the amount of income determined to provide a decent standard of living. In public policy, advocates define the living wage as the minimum income necessary for a worker to meet their basic needs. Basic needs include housing, food, healthcare, and other essential needs. \r\n\r\nThe living wage should pay for the cost of living in any location and should also be adjusted to compensate for inflation. The purpose of the living wage is to make sure that all full-time workers are compensated enough to live above the federal poverty level. \r\n\r\nThe living wage and minimum wage are different although they are often used interchangeably. The U.S. Congress created the minimum wage with the intent to provide a living wage. The minimum wage, however, is an amount set by law whereas the living wage is determined by the average costs to live or cover basic needs. \r\n\r\nThe minimum wage is $7.25 an hour, which does equate a livable wage and would set a full-time worker earning that wage below the federal poverty line of $26,200 for a family of four. A livable wage in the least expensive city in the United States, Harlington, Texas, is $10.47 an hour. In Manhattan, the most expensive city, the livable wage is $17.46 an hour, and one would still need roommates.\r\n\r\nItâs complicated for the U.S. government to demand certain wages in certain areas. This level of government involvement would constitute a command economy, contradicting the free market economy we currently have. \r\n\r\nThe Massachusetts Institute of Technologyâs [Living Wage Calculator](https://livingwage.mit.edu/) shows the minimum wage, poverty wage, and living wage for each of the 50 states and the counties in them. \r\n\r\nWashington D.C. has the highest livable wage in the United States of $67,867 per year. Washington D.C. generally attracts lawyers, government workers, politicians, and lobbyists that can afford the lifestyle, but also has plenty of suburbs that are less expensive than living in the city. \r\n\r\nHawaii has the second-highest livable wage in the United States of $60,000 per year. The reason for Hawaiiâs expensive cost of living is because itâs an island where mainland imports are expensive. \r\n\r\nMassachusetts has the third-highest livable wage of $59,560. This comes as no surprise as the northeast is the most expensive region in the country. Connecticut, also in the northeast has the fourth-highest livable wage in the country at $59,502. \r\n\r\nNew York state has the fifth-highest livable wage of $59,128. It is well-known that New York City is the most expensive city in the United States, but the rest of the state is pricey as well.\r\n\r\nKentucky has the lowest livable wage in the United States of $43,308, followed by Arkansas of just $44,571. The third lowest livable wage in the United States is in West Virginia of $44,823. These three states have some of the least expensive housing of all 50 states, so a person looking for a two-bedroom apartment can expect to pay less than $1,000 a month.\r\n\r\nSouth Dakota has the fourth-lowest livable wage in the United States of $45,410, most likely because South Dakota is not densely-packed and highly desirable like Washington D.C. or New York. South Dakota is the fifth-least populated state in the U.S. Idaho follows with the fifth-lowest livable wage of $45,801.\r\n\r\nA full map of each stateâs livable wage can be found [here.](https://research.zippia.com/living-wage.html) The livable wages are for states; however, counties and cities within states can have varying livable wages as well. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","data":{"customMeta":{"relatedArticles":["job-growth-by-state","at-will-employment-states","employment-rate-by-state","right-to-work-states","livable-wage-by-state","minimum-wage-by-state","nursing-compact-states","mpre-scores-by-state","union-states"]}},"lastModified":"2020-04-06T20:09:05.160Z","path":"livable-wage-by-state","name":"Livable Wage By State"},{"article":"An LLC, or limited liability company, is a business structure that is a hybrid of a corporation and a partnership or sole proprietorship. The owners of an LLC are not personally liable for the companyâs debts or liabilities. LLCs typically combine the flow-through taxation of partnerships and the limited liabilities of corporations. Any entity can form an LLC except for banks and insurance companies. \r\n\r\n## Advantages and Disadvantages of LLCs\r\n\r\nAdvantages of LLCs include personal asset protection, where members are not personally responsible for the LLCâs debts or lawsuits, and flow-through taxation, where profits and losses are passed through to the members, who claim them on their tax returns. Additionally, LLCs offer simplicity by being relatively easy to form and maintain, unlike S- or C-Corporations. LLCs also tend to have more credibility than sole proprietorships and partnerships due to having a more formal business structure.\r\n\r\nDisadvantages of LLCs include a higher cost of operation than a sole proprietorship or partnership, the possibility of dissolving upon the death or bankruptcy of a member, and the downsides of flow-through taxes. Flow-through taxation is beneficial in some ways; however, LLC owners are responsible for paying taxes on their personal share of LLC income, whether or not they are given a disbursement. Additionally, LLCs are not the most suitable option if the founder is looking to become a publicly-traded company. \r\n\r\n\r\n## What Fees Do LLCs Pay?\r\n\r\nLLCs are formal partnerships, with the owners referred to as âmembersâ that require articles of organization to be filed with the state followed by a fee paid directly to the state. Additionally, paperwork and other fees will need to be submitted at the federal level to obtain an employer identification number. \r\n\r\nLLC regulations vary from state to state, including filing fees that range anywhere from $50 to $500 and annual or biennial fees that arrange from $0 to $800. An LLC filing fee is a one-time fee paid to create an LLC and an LLC annual or biennial fee is a mandatory, on-going fee paid either every one or two years that keeps your LLC in compliance. Failure to file an LLCâs report and the annual or biennial fee will result in the LLC being shut down in 90% of states in the U.S. \r\n\r\nStates with the least-expensive filing fee of $50 are Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Hawaii, Iowa, Michigan, Mississippi, and New Mexico. Massachusettsâs $500 filing fee is the most expensive among states. \r\n\r\nAs for the mandatory, on-going annual or biennial fees, several states have a $0 fee: Arizona, Idaho, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, New Mexico, Ohio, South Carolina, and Texas. California has the most expensive annual fee of $800 per year plus an additional $20 every two years.  \r\n","lastModified":"2020-04-06T20:09:05.160Z","path":"llc-cost-by-state","name":"Llc Cost By State"},{"article":"The United States is made up of 50 states, but 48 states â also known as the conterminous states, the lower 48, or the contiguous states â are adjoined.

Magazines come in various shapes and sizes and can be either removable or integral to the firearm. \r\n\r\nLarge-capacity magazines, also known has high-capacity magazines, are typically magazines with a high number of rounds of ammunition and are usually associated with semi-automatic assault weapons or machine guns. Large-capacity magazines typically have ten or more rounds of ammunition, although this number is arbitrary and not universally agreed upon.\r\n\r\nLarge-capacity magazines enable a shooter to fire repeatedly without taking the time to reload, increasing the shooterâs ability to injure and kill large numbers of people in a short amount of time. Large-capacity magazines have been used in all ten of the deadliest mass shooting in the last ten years. \r\n\r\nFor example, the Las Vegas shooter in 2017 was able to shoot 90 rounds within ten seconds without having to reload. He was using an assault rifle with a bump stock and large capacity magazine. The shooter killed 50 people and injured hundreds. \r\n\r\nIn 1994, Congress adopted the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, which banned the manufacture, transfer, and possession of semi-automatic weapons and made it unlawful to transfer or possess large-capacity ammunition feeding devices. This act expired in 2004 but did work to reduce the use of large-capacity magazines in crime down to 10%. This number climbed back to 22% by 2010.\r\n\r\nThe federal ban on large-capacity magazines has ended, however, nine states and the District of Columbia have enacted laws banning large-capacity magazines. These states are:\r\n\r\n-\tCalifornia\r\n-\tColorado\r\n-\tConnecticut\r\n-\tDistrict of Columbia\r\n-\tHawaii\r\n-\tMaryland\r\n-\tMassachusetts\r\n-\tNew Jersey\r\n-\tNew York\r\n-\tVermont\r\n\r\nEach of these nine states has its own specific regulations regarding capacity limit, prohibited acts of large-capacity magazines, and the treatment of pre-owned large-capacity magazines. For example, in Colorado, the legal magazine capacity is 15 rounds.

Cannabis is a psychoactive drug that can be used for recreational or medicinal purposes. Twenty years ago, marijuana was illegal in all 50 states; however, today, 33 states have legislation allowing for marijuana use in some form.\r\n\r\nIn 1996, California voters passed Proposition 215, legalizing medical marijuana. California became the first state to legalize medical marijuana. Within the following four years, several other states followed by passing their own medical marijuana legislation, including Alaska, the District of Columbia, Oregon, Washington, Maine, Colorado, Hawaii, and Nevada. Since then, more states have gradually voted to pass legislation allowing for medical marijuana use.\r\n\r\nIn 2012, Colorado and Washington became the first states to legalize marijuana for recreational use. Since then, nine states have followed by legalizing marijuana for recreational use. The 11 states (and Washington D.C.) where recreational and medical marijuana are legal are:\r\n\r\n1.\tAlaska\r\n2.\tCalifornia\r\n3.\tColorado\r\n4.\tDistrict of Columbia\r\n5.\tIllinois\r\n6.\tMaine\r\n7.\tMassachusetts\r\n8.\tNevada\r\n9.\tOregon\r\n10.\tVermont\r\n11.\tWashington\r\n12.\tWisconsin\r\n\r\nWhile recreational marijuana is legal in Vermont and Washington D.C., both jurisdictions have barred sales for recreation purposes but allow possessing and growing.\r\n\r\nThe following 22 states have legalized medical marijuana only:\r\n\r\n1.\tArizona\r\n2.\tArkansas\r\n3.\tConnecticut\r\n4.\tDelaware\r\n5.\tFlorida\r\n6.\tHawaii\r\n7.\tLouisiana\r\n8.\tMaryland\r\n9.\tMinnesota\r\n10.\tMissouri\r\n11.\tMontana\r\n12.\tNew Hampshire\r\n13.\tNew Jersey\r\n14.\tNew Mexico\r\n15.\tNew York\r\n16.\tNorth Dakota\r\n17.\tOhio\r\n18.\tOklahoma\r\n19.\tPennsylvania\r\n20.\tRhode Island\r\n21.\tUtah\r\n22.\tWest Virginia\r\n\r\nEach state has strict regulations regarding their marijuana laws for both medical and recreational use. Medical marijuana users must see a marijuana doctor to be approved for and obtain a medical marijuana card, which requires follow-up appointments and annual renewal. One must be at least 21 years old to purchase recreational marijuana. Most states require that marijuana only be sold from dispensaries, which are heavily regulated. The amount of marijuana that one can buy, possess and grow is also restricted and varies by state. For example, California allows users to buy up to eight grams of concentrates and can have no more than six marijuana plants.\r\n\r\nBecause marijuana is still illegal on the federal level, it is automatically illegal in all states unless legislation has previously passed. \r\n\r\nBelow is a table of each stateâs legality regarding

defined as an incident that involves several victims of gun violence. There is not an exact definition, but several groups have come up with specific criteria for what defines a mass shooting. The Gun Violence Archive states that a mass shooting involves at least four people aside from the perpetrator of the act. These victims must have been shot in the same location at approximately the same time. On the other hand, the Congressional Research Service has defined a mass shooting a little differently, stating that a mass shooting has fatalities. \n\nFor the purpose of this article, weâre going to look at data based on the Gun Violence Archiveâs definition. This means that a mass shooting is defined as four or more people that were shot at the same general location and time. This data also looks at mass shootings since 2013 through August 2019.

The U.S. maternal mortality rate measures the rate of deaths from any cause related to or aggravated by pregnancy childbirth, or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy.\r\n\r\nThe United States has the highest maternal mortality rate of any developed country and the maternal mortality rate is higher than it has been in decades. Based on the most recent data from 2018 the maternal mortality rate in the U.S. is 17.4 deaths per 100,000 births. The United States is also the only developed to country see maternal mortality rates rising. This is attributed to a few findings in an [NPR report]( https://www.npr.org/2017/05/12/528098789/u-s-has-the-worst-rate-of-maternal-deaths-in-the-developed-world), including that hospitals are generally unprepared or underprepared for maternal emergencies during childbirth. Additionally, some doctors entering into maternal-fetal medicine were able to complete their training without training in a labor-delivery unit.\r\n\r\nRecently, states have passed legislation leading to stricter abortion laws, which opponents worry could result in higher maternal mortality rates. They argue that because doctors are concerned about losing their licenses, they might hesitate to perform an abortion on a patient even it is a medical emergency. Additionally, mothers might turn to illegal, unsafe abortion options to circumvent the new restrictions.\r\n\r\n## States with the Lowest Maternal Mortality Rates\r\n\r\n#### California \r\nCalifornia has the lowest maternal mortality rate of 4.0 deaths per 100,000 births. \r\nFrom 2006 to 2013, Californiaâs maternal mortality rate [declined by 55%](https://www.cmqcc.org/research/ca-pamr-maternal-mortality-review), from 16.9 to 7.3 and continued to decline thereafter. California is leading the way in efforts to reduce the number of maternal mortalities thanks to the formation of the California Maternal Quality Care Collaborative in 2006. This committee found that death from two well-known complications, hemorrhage and preeclampsia, can be prevented through recognition, teamwork, and a list ofthoroughly-practiced treatments. Because of this type of preparation in hospitals, California doctors and nurses have been able to save hundreds of lives.\r\n\r\n#### Massachusetts\r\nMassachusettsâs maternal mortality rate of 8.4 per 100,000 births makes it the state with the second-lowest maternal mortality rate in the United States. Massachusettsâs maternal death review has been around for more than 20 years. The committee recommended a requirement for all hospitals to have a procedure in place for hemorrhages in 2014. Massachusetts is overall one of the healthiest states for women and children, with low rates of uninsured women and the lowest teenage birth rate in the U.S.\r\n#### Nevada\r\nNevada is tied with Massachusetts for the second-lowest maternal mortality rate in the country of 8.4 deaths per 100,000 births. In May 2019, Governor Steve Sisolak signed legislation to create Nevadaâs first statewide Maternal Mortality Review Committee. Despite Nevadaâs low maternal mortality rate, the state ranks poorly for women and childrenâs health overall. Nevada has one of the lowest family medicine, pediatric, and obstetrician/gynecological physicians per capita, as well as a high percentage of women who are uninsured during pregnancy.\r\n\r\n#### Connecticut\r\nConnecticut has the fourth-lowest maternal mortality rate in the United States of 10.5 deaths per 100,000 births. In Connecticut, midwives may be the answer to decreasing the rate since they are often more attentive throughout pregnancy than OB-GYNs. There are 211 licensed nurse-midwives in Connecticut, who are required to have advanced nursing degrees and additional training in midwifery. Midwives are [linked to](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0192523) higher rates of physiologic birth and fewer adverse neonatal outcomes. \r\n\r\n#### Colorado\r\nColorado has the fifth-lowest maternal mortality rate in the United States of 11.5 per 100,000 births. Half of all deaths in Colorado among pregnant women and those within the first year after giving birth are the result of self-harm, such as suicide and overdose. Colorado doctors, midwives, and mental health experts are focusing on reviewing medical files, prescriptions, coronersâ reports, and even suicide notes to help saves lives from pregnancy-related complications, drug abuse, and suicide. Colorado physicians and policymakers believe that maternal mortality review committees are the key to saving lives. \r\n\r\n## States with the Highest Maternal Mortality Rates\r\n\r\n#### Louisiana \r\nLouisianaâs maternal mortality rate of 58.1 deaths per 100,000 births is the highest in the United States. The rate is about four times higher for black mothers than it is for white mothers, an issue that boils down to implicit bias. 59% of black maternal deaths are preventable, compared to 9% of white maternal deaths. Louisianaâs Joint Commission will be looking for new standards around pregnancy-related medical problems such as hemorrhaging and hypertension to be in place starting in January 2021. Additionally, state officials are rallying around the goal of reducing maternal deaths by 20% by Motherâs Day 2020. \r\n\r\n#### Georgia\r\nGeorgia has the second-highest rate of maternal mortality of 48.4 per 100,000. Georgiaâs maternal mortality review issued a 2017 report that said the areas of highest concern include inadequate follow-up of cardiovascular symptoms in pregnant women and failure to recognize and treat hypertension or hemorrhages soon enough. Researchers have reported that in more than one-third of cases, they were unsure of when prenatal care began for mothers and confirmed that some who died received more prenatal care at all. Black mothers in Georgia are more likely to die from pregnancy, as they are in the rest of the United States, and especially in the stateâs rural areas.\r\n\r\n#### Indiana\r\nIndianaâs maternal mortality rate is 43.6 per 100,000, making it the third-highest in the country. There are 33 counties in Indiana that have no hospital or that have a hospital but the hospital has no OB-GYN services. The Indiana State Department of Health plans to survey every birthing and delivery facility in the state to make sure they are meeting its new rules, such as requiring at-risk moms to deliver at facilities that have appropriate technology, equipment, and personnel on hand to manage these emergencies. Additionally, the state will hire nurses, midwives, and advanced practice nurses to go into some of Indianaâs rural hospitals to help provide prenatal care. \r\n\r\n#### New Jersey\r\nNew Jersey has the fourth-highest maternal mortality rate of 38.1 deaths per 100,000 births. According to the [2018 Health of Women and Children Report](https://www.americashealthrankings.org/learn/reports/2018-health-of-women-and-children-report), New Jersey had the highest mortality rate among black mothers of 102.3 deaths per 100,000 births. In January 2019, a package of 14 bills was advanced by state lawmakers that included awareness, education, evaluation protocols, and Medicaid coverage to help combat the alarming maternal mortality rate. \r\n\r\n#### Arkansas\r\nArkansas has the fifth-highest maternal mortality rate in the United States of 37.5 per 100,000. Conway Regional Hospital OB-GYN Amy Johnson said that part of what contributes to the high rate in Arkansas is overweight and obese mothers being at higher risk of developing life-threatening problems during pregnancy. This is a common issue among southern states. HB1440 was passed in Arkansas to create a maternal mortality review committee to help understand pregnancy-related deaths and to help improve maternal health and prevent these deaths in the future. \r\n\r\n\r\nBelow is a table of each stateâs maternal mortality rate.

Medicaid is the largest source of funding for medical and health-related services for people with low income in the US, with 74 million people enrolled.\r\n\r\nResearch suggests that Medicaid improves health insurance coverage, access to health care, recipientsâ financial security and economic benefits to states and health providers. Medicaid offers additional benefits not covered by Medicare, such as nursing home care. \r\n\r\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), also known as the Affordable Care Act or Obamacare, was signed into law by President Obama in 2010. The act expanded Medicaid eligibility and cut the uninsured population in half by 2016. \r\n\r\nWho is eligible for Medicaid? There are some [mandatory eligibility groups](https://www.medicaid.gov/medicaid-chip-program-information/by-topics/waivers/1115/downloads/list-of-eligibility-groups.pdf) such as low-income families, individuals receiving Supplemental Security Income (SSI), and qualified pregnant women and children. Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI) is used to determine financial eligibility for Medicaid and considers taxable income and tax filing relationships. Additionally, individuals must also be residents of the state they are receiving Medicaid from and are either citizens of the United States or are a certain qualified non-citizen, such as a permanent resident. Some eligibility groups are limited by age, pregnancy, or parenting status. Lastly, states can establish a âmedically needy programâ for individuals whose income is too high to qualify for Medicaid but can still become eligible by âspending downâ or incurring expenses for medical care for which they do not have health insurance.\r\n\r\nIndividuals who are interested in enrolling in Medicaid should look into their own stateâs program to see if they qualify and how to apply.\r\n\r\nThe ten states with the highest Medicaid enrollment are:\r\n\r\n1.\tCalifornia (10,390,661)\r\n2.\tNew York (5,853,034)\r\n3.\tFlorida (3,919,790)\r\n4.\tTexas (3,563,308)\r\n5.\tPennsylvania (2,746,288)\r\n6.\tIllinois (2,533,771)\r\n7.\tOhio (2,448,538)\r\n8.\tMichigan (2,217,663)\r\n9.\tNorth Carolina (1,762,569)\r\n10.\tWashington (1,643,705)\r\n\r\nOf these states, seven have state-expanded Medicaid: California, New York, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Ohio, Michigan, and Washington.\r\n\r\nCalifornia has the highest number of Medicaid-enrolled individuals with 10,390,661. California has a total of 11,625,691 individuals in Medicaid and Childrenâs Health Insurance Programs (CHIP), an almost 50% increase since the first Marketplace Open Enrollment Period in October of 2013. \r\n\r\nBelow is a table with each stateâs total number of individuals enrolled in Medicaid and CHIP.\r\n","data":{"states":[],"customMeta":{"note":"* CHIP stands for Childrenâs Health

residents would say that one of the biggest problems in the United States is the state of healthcare. Not only is healthcare expensive, but not everyone has access to insurance that makes it more affordable. While the Affordable Care Act did help some low-income households, other individuals and families still struggle without healthcare. \n\nOne of the nationâs programs that strives to help low-income individuals have access to healthcare is Medicaid. This federal program allows children, parents, pregnant women, and adults to receive the care they need despite having a low income. \n\nQualifying for Medicaid varies by state. The primary difference is the income level required to qualify. If you earn too much income, you will not qualify for this federal program and will need to seek other forms of assistance for healthcare. \n\nFor this article, weâre going to look at the income limits by state for parents of one child, as well as other adults. All numbers are based on the Federal Poverty Level, or FPL. The FPL is determined by the Department of Health and Human Services. This number is used to determine who is eligible for programs like Medicaid and other benefits, such as low-income government housing programs and food stamps. This rate is adjusted every year in January based on inflation. \n\nAs of 2019, the FPL for a family of three is $21,330 in the 48 contiguous states plus the District of Columbia. In Alaska, this number rises to $26,600. In Hawaii, the FPL for a family of three is $24,540. For an individual, the contiguous U.S. has determined the FPL to be $12,490. In Alaska, this number rises to $15,600, while Hawaii has an FPL for individuals at $14,380. \n\nThe state with the highest income limits for both a family of three and individuals is Washington, D.C. If you live in this area, a family of three can qualify for Medicaid if their income is at 221% of the FPL. For other adults, the limit is set at 251% of the FPL. \n\nThe next state with the highest income limits is Connecticut, which has limits of 155% of the FPL for parents and 138% for other adults. Indiana comes in third with limits of 139% of the FPL for parents and adults. \n\nA large number of states have set income limits for both parents and adults at 138% of the FPL. These states include West Virginia, Washington, Vermont, Rhode Island, Pennsylvania, Oregon, Ohio, North Dakota, and New York, just to name a few. \n\nOn the other side of the coin, Texas has the lowest income limits of all of the U.S. states. Income limits for Medicaid for parents is 17% of the FPL. Alabama doesnât come far behind with income limits of 18%. Other states with Medicaid income limits that fall below 100% of the FPL include Missouri, Idaho, Mississippi, Florida, Georgia, Kansas, Virginia, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Wyoming, Utah, Nebraska, South Carolina, and Tennessee. \n","data":{"states":[],"customMeta":{"columns":["state",{"header":"Parents (Family of 3)","field":"parents","format":"perc"},{"header":"Other Adults","field":"otherAdults","format":"perc"},"population"],"chloroMap":{"field":"otherAdults"},"sortField":"state","sortAsc":true,"showAllStates":true,"relatedArticles":["federal-aid-by-state","medicaid-enrollment-by-state","medicaid-income-limits-by-state","states-that-expanded-medicaid","welfare-recipients-by-state","unemployment-benefits-by-state","unemployment-rate-by-state"]},"customData":[{"otherAdults":1.38,"parents":1.38,"state":"United States"},{"otherAdults":0,"parents":0.18,"state":"Alabama"},{"otherAdults":1.38,"parents":1.38,"state":"Alaska"},{"otherAdults":1.38,"parents":1.38,"state":"Arizona"},{"otherAdults":1.38,"parents":1.38,"state":"Arkansas"},{"otherAdults":1.38,"parents":1.38,"state":"California"},{"otherAdults":1.38,"parents":1.38,"state":"Colorado"},{"otherAdults":1.38,"parents":1.55,"state":"Connecticut"},{"otherAdults":1.38,"parents":1.38,"state":"Delaware"},{"otherAdults":2.15,"parents":2.21,"state":"District of Columbia"},{"otherAdults":0,"parents":0.32,"state":"Florida"},{"otherAdults":0,"parents":0.35,"state":"Georgia"},{"otherAdults":1.38,"parents":1.38,"state":"Hawaii"},{"otherAdults":0,"parents":0.25,"state":"Idaho"},{"otherAdults":1.38,"parents":1.38,"state":"Illinois"},{"otherAdults":1.39,"parents":1.39,"state":"Indiana"},{"otherAdults":1.38,"parents":1.38,"state":"Iowa"},{"otherAdults":0,"parents":0.38,"state":"Kansas"},{"otherAdults":1.38,"parents":1.38,"state":"Kentucky"},{"otherAdults":1.38,"parents":1.38,"state":"Louisiana"},{"otherAdults":0,"parents":1.05,"state":"Maine"},{"otherAdults":1.38,"parents":1.38,"state":"Maryland"},{"otherAdults":1.38,"parents":1.38,"state":"Massachusetts"},{"otherAdults":1.38,"parents":1.38,"state":"Michigan"},{"otherAdults":1.38,"parents":1.38,"state":"Minnesota"},{"otherAdults":0,"parents":0.26,"state":"Mississippi"},{"otherAdults":0,"parents":0.21,"state":"Missouri"},{"otherAdults":1.38,"parents":1.38,"state":"Montana"},{"otherAdults":0,"parents":0.63,"state":"Nebraska"},{"otherAdults":1.38,"parents":1.38,"state":"Nevada"},{"otherAdults":1.38,"parents":1.38,"state":"New Hampshire"},{"otherAdults":1.38,"parents":1.38,"state":"New Jersey"},{"otherAdults":1.38,"parents":1.38,"state":"New Mexico"},{"otherAdults":1.38,"parents":1.38,"state":"New York"},{"otherAdults":0,"parents":0.42,"state":"North Carolina"},{"otherAdults":1.38,"parents":1.38,"state":"North Dakota"},{"otherAdults":1.38,"parents":1.38,"state":"Ohio"},{"otherAdults":0,"parents":0.42,"state":"Oklahoma"},{"otherAdults":1.38,"parents":1.38,"state":"Oregon"},{"otherAdults":1.38,"parents":1.38,"state":"Pennsylvania"},{"otherAdults":1.38,"parents":1.38,"state":"Rhode Island"},{"otherAdults":0,"parents":0.67,"state":"South Carolina"},{"otherAdults":0,"parents":0.49,"state":"South Dakota"},{"otherAdults":0,"parents":0.95,"state":"Tennessee"},{"otherAdults":0,"parents":0.17,"state":"Texas"},{"otherAdults":0,"parents":0.6,"state":"Utah"},{"otherAdults":1.38,"parents":1.38,"state":"Vermont"},{"otherAdults":0,"parents":0.38,"state":"Virginia"},{"otherAdults":1.38,"parents":1.38,"state":"Washington"},{"otherAdults":1.38,"parents":1.38,"state":"West Virginia"},{"otherAdults":1,"parents":1,"state":"Wisconsin"},{"otherAdults":0,"parents":0.54,"state":"Wyoming"}]},"sources":[{"name":"Where Are States Today?

Itâs the ultimate fantasy to have more money than you know what to do with, being able to purchase everything youâve ever wanted without lifting a finger ever again. For people that win the lottery, this dream is actually a reality. \n \nOne of the most popular lotteries to play in the United States is Mega Millions. Mega Millions first made its appearance in the U.S. in 1996. At the time of its introduction, however, it was known as The Big Game. This was later changed to The Big Game Mega Millions before finally being called Mega Millions, which is the name of the game today. \n \nThe Mega Millions winning numbers are drawn twice per week. Every Tuesday and Friday, the drawings are held at WSB-TV studio in Atlanta, Georgia. The minimum jackpot for Mega Millions is $40 million, which is paid in installments over a period of 30 years. Winners can also take an immediate payout. However, the total amount received is less than taking installments. \n \nTo play Mega Millions, a person must be over the age of 18. Each game requires a ticket, which costs $2. In most states, a Megaplier option is available for an additional dollar. This adds a multiplier to non-jackpot prizes. Winners can pick their own numbers or can have random numbers selected by their chosen lottery retailer. \n \nIf there are no winners for one nightâs drawing, the amount of the jackpot continues to climb until there is a winner. The largest jackpot in the history of the game was during the October 23, 2018 drawing.

This is especially true in suburbs surrounding large cities where people want to live within proximity to the city center without the extreme housing costs. \r\n\r\nGiven this, communities are increasingly imposing larger minimum lot sizes and area requirements, especially in residential communities. Zoning ordinances, building and housing codes, and subdivision regulations are being imposed in these areas to preserve the semi-rural living attributes such as scattered homes, adequate space, and low-density housing. The motivations for doing so could include preserving the health and safety of the community, including concerns about fire, noise, circulation of air, and pollution. Some believe that such regulations are imposed because the wealthy want to exclude less wealthy groups from their communities. \r\n\r\nCommunities have the power to regulate the density of their neighborhoods indirectly through provisions such as minimum lot area per family; lot dimensions, frontage, depth, and yards; and type of structure. \r\n\r\nMost states have adopted building and zoning codes from the [International Residential Code (IRC)]( https://www.iccsafe.org/products-and-services/i-codes/2018-i-codes/irc/). The IRC codes require that all homes must be built on a minimum of 320 square feet. The minimum square footage for a house if 120 square feet and at least one room must be habitable. Habitable rooms meet other regulations such as needing a closet and at least one window. Other rooms, not meant for sleeping, must be at least 70 square feet.  Bathrooms and kitchens do not have minimum floor spaces; however, all rooms must have ceiling heights of at least seven to eight feet tall. Minimum house sizes, however, vary greatly between states, towns, and counties. Some areas require new homes to have a minimum of 1000 square feet.\r\n\r\nIn addition to growing communities, [âtiny homesâ](https://www.viewpointcloud.com/blog/local-government-resources/governments-guide-tiny-house-regulation/)\r\n have become increasingly popular and are difficult to construct and permanently reside in due to local government building and zoning requirements. There are two types of tiny homes: tiny homes on wheels considered to be RVs (recreation vehicles) and tiny homes on foundation considered to be accessory dwelling units (ADUs). Tiny homes that are registered as RVs do not need to deal with zoning or building code concerns and will only need a place to legally park it. \r\n\r\nBecause of these homesâ extremely small and minimalist design, many states have to adjust housing regulations to include the new trend. \r\n\r\nAll tiny homes have two important factors to consider: building codes and zoning regulations. Building codes include a minimum ceiling height of 6 feet 8 inches for common areas (6 feet 4 inches in bathrooms), one separate bathroom, enough windows to meet the emergency exit requirements, and a ladder or stairs to reach the loft. \r\n\r\nAs previously mentioned, some states have adopted the IRC code; however, some counties, towns, and neighborhoods have adopted their own regulations. When building a home, one should always check with their local jurisdiction to find out what the minimum specifications are. Some places have [no minimum size restrictions](https://americantinyhouseassociation.org/places-with-no-minimum-size-for-houses/).\r\n\r\nBelow is the minimum house size allowed in each state. Some minimum house sizes apply to tiny homes as accessory dwelling units (ADUs).

The Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (FLSA) set the first federal minimum wage at $0.25 per hour for covered workers. The minimum wage has since then increased a total of 22 times, the most recent in 2009. The Federal Minimum Wage in the United States is currently $7.25 per hour, according to the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA); however, several states have raised their minimum wage higher than the federal minimum. If the state, city, or county minimum wage is higher than the federal minimum wage, employers are required to pay their workers the higher amount.\n\nThere are several resources online that provided state and city minimum wages. The National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL) published a table reflecting current state minimum wages as of January 1st, 2019. \n\n29 states and D.C. currently have minimum wages above the federal minimum wage of $7.25. The highest minimum wage among these states is $12, which Washington, California, and Massachusetts have adopted. Washington D.C. currently has the highest minimum wage in the United States at $13.25. \n\nAlabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, and Tennessee have not adopted a state minimum wage and therefore have adopted the $7.25 federal minimum wage. New Hampshire repealed its state minimum in 2011, adopting the $7.25 minimum as well.\n\nThe five highest minimum wages in the United States are located as follows:\n1.Â Washington D.C. at $13.25\n2.Â California, Massachusetts, and Washington at $12.00\n3.Â New York and Colorado at $11.10\n4.Â Vermont at $10.78\n5.Â Oregon at $10.75\n\nThe lowest minimum wage in the United States is $5.15, set by Georgia and Wyoming. Employees who are covered under the federal Fair Labor Standards Act will be paid at least the federal minimum wage of $7.25; however, those who are not covered under the FSLA may be paid $5.15.\n\nAccording to this information from the NCSL, several states have enacted legislation to raise their minimum wages by increments over the next several years. One example of these states is New Jersey, where the minimum wage will increase by $1.00 on January 1st of every year until it reaches $15.00 by January 1st, 2024. Other states who have also enacted future increases to reach a $15.00 minimum wage over the next several years are:\n\n- New York (rate adjusted for inflation after 12/31/2020 until it reaches $15.00)\n- Massachusetts (effective 1/1/2023)\n- Illinois (effective 1/1/2025)\n- Maryland (effective 1/1/2025)\n- California (effective 1/1/2022)\n- Washington D.C. (effective 7/1/2020)\n\nTwo states have enacted gradual increases to a minimum wage of $13.50:\n\n- Oregon (effective 7/1/2022)\n- Washington (effective 1/1/2020)\n- Six states have enacted gradual increases to a minimum wage of $12:\n- Arizona (effective 1/1/2020)\n- Colorado (effective 1/1/2020)\n- Maine (effective 1/1/2020)\n- Michigan ($12.05 effective 2030)\n- Missouri (effective 1/1/2023)\n- New Mexico (effective 1/1/2023)\nÂ \nSome states have two minimum wages, depending on specific employment conditions. For example, Nevadaâs minimum wage for an employee who receives health benefits is $7.25 and the minimum wage for those who do not receive health benefits is $8.25. In Montana, the minimum wage for businesses with gross annual sales of $110,000 or less is $4.00; however, the minimum wage is $8.10 for all other businesses. \n\nSeveral states have different minimum wages for tipped workers vs. non-tipped workers. The minimum wage for tipped workers can be as low as $2.13 per hour in some states (the federal minimum wage for tipped employees), but some states require that tipped employees are paid the stateâs minimum wage for non-tipped employees.\n\nBelow is a complete table of the minimum wage by state as of January 1st, 2019.\n","data":{"states":[],"customMeta":{"columns":["state",{"header":"Minimum Wage","field":"minimumWage","format":{"7":"none","DEFAULT_FORMATTER":"moneyWithCurrency"},"columnWidth":150},{"header":"Future Increases","field":"futureIncreases"},{"header":"Automatic Adjustments","field":"automaticAdjustments"},"population"],"sortField":"minimumWage","showAllStates":true,"chloroMap":{"field":"minimumWage"},"relatedArticles":["job-growth-by-state","at-will-employment-states","employment-rate-by-state","right-to-work-states","livable-wage-by-state","minimum-wage-by-state","nursing-compact-states","mpre-scores-by-state","union-states"]},"customData":[{"futureIncreases":"","state":"Alabama","minimumWage":7,"automaticAdjustments":""},{"futureIncreases":"","state":"Alaska","minimumWage":9.89,"automaticAdjustments":"Indexed annual increases begin Jan. 1, 2017.

Each league is divided into three divisions, East, Central and West, five teams in each division. 29 teams are in the United States, and 1 is in Canada. Additionally, there are 256 Minor League Baseball teams, each affiliated with Major League clubs.\n\nA regular season for an MLB team is 162 games, and five teams in each league advance to a four-round playoff tournament that leads to a best-of-seven championship called the World Series.

What are conservative politics?\n\nThe Republican Party is the major conservative party in the United States. Conservative politics aims for a smaller, deregulated government and desires to preserve the political philosophy and regulations articulated in the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution. There is an aversion to rapid change and a strong belief that traditional morality, such as that articulated in the Bible, needs to be preserved. Additionally, conservatives also emphasize the importance of free-market capitalism and free trade. \n\nConservative politics generally opposes liberal politics, which generally places a greater value on social justice, ensuring access to healthcare, regulating economic activity, and social equality. A few of the most liberal states in the US are Hawaii, Massachusetts, and California. The Democratic Party is considered to be the liberal political party of the United States. US citizens typically identify as either Democratic or Republican, or liberal or conservative. \n\nConservative states are those states with a predominantly conservative population that consistently elect conservative-leaning legislation. Conservative states often have low taxes, limited gun laws, high religious participation, and limited business regulations. \nWyoming is the most conservative state in the US. 67% of residents in Wyoming identify as Republican or Republican-leaning. Wyoming has low taxes across the board, including no state income tax. The state has elected a Republican Party candidate for every presidential election since the 1950s, except for the 1964 election. \n\nThe following is a list of the most conservative states in the United States. These findings are based on a Gallup 2018 tracking poll. States with a gap of 20 points or greater are considered âhighly conservative.â\n\n#### 1. Mississippi\nMississippi is the most conservative state in the U.S. with 50% of the population being conservative. 29% of Mississippi residents are moderate, and 12% are liberal, the smallest percentage of every state. With a gap of 38 points, Mississippi is considered to be âhighly conservative.â In the 2016 election, 57.9% of Mississippi voters voted Republican, which came at no surprise considering that Mississippi has not voted Democratic since 1976. Unsurprisingly, Mississippi has a high concentration of church-goers, which is significant as conservative politics are tied with traditions in the Bible. \n\n#### 2. Wyoming\nWyoming is the second-most conservative state in the U.S. 46% of residents in Wyoming identify as Conservative. Wyoming has low taxes across the board, including no state income tax. Wyoming has elected a Republican Party candidate for every presidential election since the 1950s, except for the 1964 election. About 68% of voters voted Republican in the 2016 presidential election. \n\n#### 3. Alabama\nAlabama is tied with Wyoming as the second-most conservative state in the country with 46% of voters identifying as conservative. Alabama has the second-highest conservative advantage gap of 32 points, making it a âhighly conservativeâ state. Alabama has voted Republican in the last eight presidential elections and 62.1% of voters voted Republican in the 2016 presidential election. Like Mississippi, many residents of Alabama are also avid church-goers. \n\n#### 4. West Virginia\nWest Virginia is the fourth-most conservative state in the U.S. 45% of voters identify as conservative in West Virginia, while only 17% identify as liberal, giving the state a conservative advantage of 28 points. About 68.5% of West Virginia voters voted Republican in the 2016 presidential election, the highest percentage of any state. \n#### 5. South Dakota\nWith 44% of voters identifying as conservative, South Dakota is the fifth-most conservative state in the United States. With only 13% of voters identifying as liberal, the second-smallest percentage of any state, South Dakotaâs conservative advantage is 31 points, the third-highest of any state. In the 2016 presidential election, 61.5% of voters voted Republican, a margin of 29.8% over the 31.7% who voted Democratic. \n\n#### 6. Tennessee\nTennessee is the sixth-most conservative state in the United States. 43% of voters identify as conservative and 17% identify as conservative, resulting in a conservative advantage of 26 points. In the 2016 presidential election, 60.7% of voters voted Republican. \n\n#### 7. Oklahoma\nTied with Tennessee is Oklahoma, which is also 43% conservative. The conservative advantage in Oklahoma is 25 points due to a liberal percentage of just 18%. Oklahoma has only four blue counties in the whole state as per the last election in 2018. 65.3% of voters voted Republican in the 2016 presidential election and the state has voted Republican in 15 out of the last 16 elections. \n\n#### 8. Louisiana\nLouisiana is tied with both Tennessee and Oklahoma with 43% of voters identifying as conservative. Louisiana has a conservative advantage of 28 points, the fourth-highest in the country. 58.1% of Louisiana voters voted Republican in the 2016 presidential election. The least conservative areas in Louisiana are New Orleans, Baton Rouge, and Shreveport. \n\n#### 9. Utah\nUtah is the ninth-most conservative state in the United States with 41% of voters identifying as conservative. 40% of Utah voters identify as moderates and 15% identify as liberal, giving Utah a 26-point conservative advantage. In the 2016 presidential election, 45.5% of voters voted Republican, the lowest percentage since 1992; 27.5% voted Democratic, and 21.5% voted for the Independent candidate. Like Oklahoma, Utah also has zero blue counties in the entire state. \n\n#### 10. South Carolina\nFinishing the top ten most conservative states in the U.S. is South Carolina, which is 41% conservative. South Carolina has a conservative advantage of 25 points. In the 2016 presidential election, 54.9% of voters voted Republican. Areas that voted Democratic in 2016 are around Charleston and Columbia. \n\n\n\nWhile there are very conservative states in the US, there are many very [conservative cities](https://www.forbes.com/pictures/gfii45img/the-most-and-least-conservative-cities-in-america/#5a35cfa425e5), too. Some of these cities fall within the borders of already conservative states, while other cities are outliers in their home states. Here are the ten most conservative cities in the United States:\n\n1. Mesa, Arizona\n2. Oklahoma City, Oklahoma\n3. Virginia Beach, Virginia\n4. Colorado Springs, Colorado\n5.

We could rest assured that our local, state, and federal governments are looking out for the best interest of its citizens. Unfortunately, many nations around the world deal with corruption â including the United States. \n\nAlthough the United States may not be as corrupt as some other nations in the world, there have been some notable scandals and evidence of corruption throughout the years. In some states, this is more prevalent than others. \n\nMeasuring how corrupt a state is can be difficult, and itâs not a perfect science. However, the University of Illinois at Chicago released a report in early 2019 that ranked the most corrupt states based on data from the Department of Justice. For the report, titled âCorruption in Chicago and Illinois,â data from the Public Integrity Section was used to determine which states were the most corrupt. \n\nThis report based its rankings on the number of public corruption convictions in each state. These numbers were further broken down into number of convictions per capita. Based on this data, Washington, D.C. was found to be the most corrupt in the U.S. Even though itâs not a state, Washington, D.C., which is a hub of political activity because it is the national capital, had a total of 1,159 corruption convictions, which amounted to 17.24 per capita. \n\nThe number of convictions per capita in the nationâs capital is significantly higher than the next most corrupt state, Louisiana. Even though the total number of convictions in this state was higher at 1,202, this is just 2.57 convictions per capita. \n\nComing in third on this list is Illinois, which had 2,102 corruption convictions or 1.63 per capital. Tennessee is fourth on the list with 1,015 convictions in total or 1.54 per capital. New York rounds out the top five with 2,860 corruption convictions, or 1.44 per capita. \n\nStates including Texas, Florida, and California had a high number of public corruption convictions. However, because of the population of these states is so high, they had a much lower rate of convictions per capita.  \n\n","data":{"states":["Washington DC","Louisiana","Illinois","Tennessee","New York"],"customMeta":{"note":"Conviction rate is per 10,000 people","columns":["state",{"header":"Conviction Rate","field":"convictionRate"},{"header":"Number of Convictions (1976â2016)","field":"convictions(1976-2016)","format":"numberWithCommas"},"population"],"sortField":"convictionRate","showAllStates":true,"relatedArticles":["most-conservative-states","most-corrupt-states","most-dangerous-states","most-democratic-states","most-diverse-states","most-educated-states","most-expensive-states-to-live-in","most-gerrymandered-states","most-liberal-states","most-obese-states","most-popular-car-by-state","most-racist-states","most-religious-states","most-republican-states"]},"customData":[{"state":"District of Columbia","convictionRate":17.24,"convictions(1976-2016)":1159},{"state":"Louisiana","convictionRate":2.57,"convictions(1976-2016)":1202},{"state":"Illinois","convictionRate":1.63,"convictions(1976-2016)":2102},{"state":"Tennessee","convictionRate":1.54,"convictions(1976-2016)":1015},{"state":"New York","convictionRate":1.44,"convictions(1976-2016)":2860},{"state":"Pennsylvania","convictionRate":1.41,"convictions(1976-2016)":1808},{"state":"Virginia","convictionRate":1.38,"convictions(1976-2016)":1158},{"state":"Ohio","convictionRate":1.33,"convictions(1976-2016)":1549},{"state":"New Jersey","convictionRate":1.24,"convictions(1976-2016)":1113},{"state":"Georgia","convictionRate":1.09,"convictions(1976-2016)":1115},{"state":"Florida","convictionRate":1.07,"convictions(1976-2016)":2166},{"state":"Texas","convictionRate":0.82,"convictions(1976-2016)":2249},{"state":"California","convictionRate":0.73,"convictions(1976-2016)":2864}]},"sources":[{"name":"Corruption in Chicago and Illinois","link":"http://pols.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/273/2019/02/Corrruption-Rpt-11-final.docx"}],"lastModified":"2020-04-06T20:09:05.164Z","path":"most-corrupt-states","name":"Most Corrupt States"},{"article":"Violent crime is defined as a crime in which the offender or perpetrator uses or threatens to use force upon a victim. Examples of violent crimes are murder, rape, assaults, robbery, kidnapping, manslaughter, and sexual assault, among others.\n\nFrom 1960 to 1991, the United States saw an increasing trend in violent crime, but in the period of 1992 to 2017, there has been a downward trend in violent crime in the United States (Figure 1).  This is obviously great news, but the trends in the individual states do vary.  \n\n## What states are the most dangerous?\nWhile there are different ways to define violent crime, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (âFBIâ) defines it as murder, rape, robbery, and aggravated assault.   With this oft used definition, we can rank each state based on the data compiled by the FBI.  While it should be noted that ranking the most dangerous states on this raw data can be more complicated and often allows for other variables, it is still interesting to look at the actual number of recorded crimes.\n\nThe FBI data reports the number of violent crimes per one hundred thousand people in each state and territory by year, so it is a way to assess the odds of experiencing violent crime in different states.  In simple terms, a higher number of violent crimes reported per one hundred thousand residents means you are more likely to experience a murder, rape, robbery, or assault.\n\nBelow are the ten most dangerous states in the U.S. based on 2018 data.\n\n#### 1. Alaska\n\nAlaska is the most dangerous state in the United States. Alaskaâs violent crime rate is 885 incidents per 100,000 people as of 2018 â the highest its been in five years. Alaska is considered the deadliest state for women, where 59% of women have experienced violence, whether it is sexual violence and/or intimate partner violence. Additionally, there are some villages in Alaska where law enforcement is unavailable to prevent violent crime or protect or help the victims of crimes. The danger in Alaska is especially imminent for Native Alaskans. Violent crime makes up about 21% of total reported crimes in Alaska, while property crime makes up 79% (a rate of 3,300 per 100,000).\n\n#### 2. New Mexico\n\nNew Mexico is the United Statesâ second-most dangerous state. The violent crime rate in New Mexico is 857 incidents per 100,000 people, about 11,829 violent crimes in the whole state in 2018. Albuquerque is New Mexicoâs most dangerous city, where the violent crime rate is 1,365 violent crimes per 100,000 residents. The property crime rate in New Mexico is also 3,420 per 100,000, the highest in the country. New Mexico has one of the highest poverty rates in the country at 19.5%, which is often correlated with high crime rates. \n\n#### 3. Tennessee\n\nTennessee is the third-most dangerous state in the U.S. with a violent crime rate of 623.7 incidents per 100,000 people. There were a total of 42,226 violent crimes reported in Tennessee in 2018, 30% of those crimes were in Memphis. Out of the violent crimes, 498 were murders, the 13th-highest number in the country. Tennesseeâs poverty rate is the ninth-highest in the U.S. of 15.3%. \n\n#### 4. Arkansas\n\nArkansasâs violent crime rate of 543.6 per 100,000 people makes it the fourth-most dangerous state in the U.S. Despite its high rate, from 2017 to 2018, Arkansas saw a 3.6% reduction in violent crime. Arkansasâs most dangerous cities are West Memphis, where the violent crime rate is 1970.2 per 100,000, and Pine Bluff, where the violent crime rate is 1,609.2 per 100,000. Arkansas has the countryâs fourth-highest imprisonment rate of 781 adults per 100,000 and the fifth-highest poverty rate of 17.2%. \n\n#### 5. Nevada\n\nNevada is the fifth-most dangerous state in the U.S. with a violent crime rate of 541.1 per 100,000. Nevada reported an overall violent crime rate reduction of 1.5% from 2017 to 2018, and more dramatic declines for murder and robbery by 24.1% and 20.2%, respectively. Unfortunately, Nevada saw a 22.8% increase in rape from 2017 to 2018. The most dangerous city in Nevada is North Las Vegas, which has a violent crime rate of 966.1 per 100,000.\n\n#### 6. Louisiana\n\nLouisianaâs violent crime rate is 537.5 per 100,000 people, making it the sixth-most dangerous state in the United States. That is 25,049 violent crimes committed in 2018. Louisiana also has the highest imprisonment rate in the country of 942 adults per 100,000. Louisiana also has the third-highest property crime rate of 3,276 incidents per 100,000. Louisianaâs high crime rate can be explained by its poverty rate of 18.6% and its unemployment rate of 4.9% since crime rates tends to be higher in lower-income areas with fewer economic opportunities. \n\n#### 7. Alabama\n\nAlabama is the seventh-most dangerous state in the United States. Alabamaâs violent crime rate is 519.6 per 100,000. Alabama has the fifth-highest rates for both aggravated assault and murder of 387.6 per 100,000 and 7.8 per 100,000, respectively. Alabamaâs poverty rate is 16.8%, the seventh-highest in the country. \n\n#### 8. Missouri\n\nMissouriâs violent crime rate of 502.1 per 100,000 makes it the eight-most dangerous state in the country. Missouri had a total of 607 murders in 2018, the eighth-highest number in the country, which is equivalent to 9.9 murders per 100,000 people, the second-highest rate in the country. St. Louis is one of the most violent cities in Missouri, with a rate of 1,800.4 violent crimes per 100,000 people. \n\n#### 9. South Carolina\n\nSouth Carolina is the ninth-most dangerous state in the United States. South Carolinaâs violent crime rate is the first in this list to drop below 500 at 488.3 per 100,000. This translates to 24,825 violent crimes in 2018. South Carolina has the sixth-highest rate for murders of 7.7 per 100,000 and the seventh-highest rate for aggravated assault of 362.8 per 100,000. South Carolina also has a property crime rate of 3,196 incidents per 100,000 people, the fourth-highest in the country. \n\n#### 10. Arizona\n\nFinishing the ten most dangerous states in the United States is Arizona, which has a violent crime rate of 474.9 per 100,000. Despite a high rate, Arizona saw a 4.5% drop in violent crimes between 2017 and 2018, from 505.7 per 100,000. Arizona has the sixth-highest imprisonment rate in the United States of 740 adults per 100,000. Arizonaâs most dangerous cities are Tucson, Globe, Tolleson, Page, and Winslow.  \n\n\nThe FBI also noted that the reported violent crime in general in the United States breaks down as follows: aggravated assaults accounted for 65.0% of violent crimes reported to law enforcement in 2017.  Robbery offenses accounted for 25.6% of violent crime offenses, rape (legacy definition) accounted for 8.0%, and murder accounted for 1.4%.\n\n## Regional\nThe FBI data shows there are variances and trends based on locales.  For example, you are twice as likely to experience violent crime in a large city, or metropolitan area (412.3), then in a rural area (201.6).  \nUsing the geographic division data provided by the FBI, a bar chart shows:\n\nThe Pacific, Mountain, West South Central, and East South Central divisions had the highest rates and they all increased in 2017.  The South Atlantic region was close to this âtopâ group of regions, but a drop in 2017 put this region back into the middle of the regional ranks along with the West North Central and East North central regions.\n\nThe Middle Atlantic and New England regions were the lowest and it decreased in 2017.\n\nGrouping these divisions into regions as defined by the FBI as Northeast (New England and Mid Atlantic), South (South Atlantic, East South Central, West South Central), Midwest (East North Central and West North Central), and West (Pacific and Mountain), the data shows:\n\n- The Northeast and South saw a drop in 2017, but the South had the highest number of violent crimes reported per one hundred thousand people.\n- The Midwest changed very little 2016/2017 and ranked third overall.\n- The highest increase 2016/2017 was in the West, which is now a close second to the South.\n","data":{"states":[],"customMeta":{"columns":["state",{"header":"Homicide

Dangerous States"},{"article":"There are two main political parties in the United States: the Democratic Party and the Republican Party. U.S. citizens typically lean to the left, or Democratic, or to the right, or Republican. \r\n\r\nThe modern-day Democratic Party platform tends to incorporate the views of centrists, liberals, progressives and left-wing and socialist movements. Democratic politics typically put a greater focus on social justice, social equality, regulating economic activity and ensuring access to healthcare. This is in contrast to more conservative or Republican politics, which aim for smaller deregulated government and emphasize the importance of free-market capitalism with little government involvement. Also in contrast to Republican or conservative politics, Democrats see [religionâs influence as less important](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/11/15/republicans-and-democrats-agree-religions-influence-is-waning-but-differ-in-their-reactions/) in American life and politics. \r\n\r\nDemocratic politics protect social programs, labor unions, workplace safety regulations, equal opportunity, racial equality, and disability rights. Democrats support abortion rights and the LGBTQ+ community and their rights. Additionally, Democrats tend to focus on the environment including regulating pollution and supporting clean energy initiatives. When it comes to the economy, a base social safety net provided by the welfare state and strong labor unions have historically been a part of the Democratic platform. \r\n\r\nDemocratic, or liberal, states tend to have higher taxes, more laws guaranteeing or supporting individual rights (including LGBTQ+) and equal opportunity, and have more ideologies that do not follow traditional morality, such as that articulated in the Bible. \r\n\r\nTo determine which states lean the most democratic, the [Cook Partisan Voting Index](https://cookpolitical.com/pvi-0) can be used. The Cook Partisan Voting Index (PVI) is a measurement of how strongly a U.S. state or congressional district leans toward the Democratic or Republican Party compared to the nation as a whole. For example, if the national average is 51% Democratic, and the Democratic candidate of a state wins 62% of a two-party share, then that state voted 12 percentage points more Democratic than the country, for D+12.\r\n\r\n## 10 Most Democratic States\r\n\r\n#### 1. Hawaii\r\nWith a PVI of D+18, Hawaii is the most democratic state in the United States. Hawaii joined the United States in 1959 and first participated in the presidential election in 1960. Hawaii has voted Democratic in every election except in 1972 and 1984. Hawaii native President Barack Obama won Hawaii in 2008 and 2012, earning over 70% of the vote in both elections. \r\n\r\n#### 2. Vermont\r\nVermont is the second-most Democratic state in the U.S. with a PVI of D+15. Vermont joined the Union in 1971 and has participated in every presidential election since 1792. Vermont was primarily Republican from 1854, when the party was founded, through 1988 except for the 1964 election. Vermont has been blue (Democratic) since 1992. Vermont is home to the 2020 presidential candidate Senator Bernie Sanders. \r\n\r\n#### 3. California\r\nCalifornia is the third-most Democratic state in the U.S. and by far the largest. California has 55 electoral votes, the most of any state and more than 10% of all available electoral votes. Californiaâs Partisan Voting Index is D+12. California was not always Democratic, in fact, and voted Republican in every election from 1952 to 1988 except for 1964. The state has consistently been Democratic since 1992 and is projected to vote Democratic in the upcoming 2020 presidential election. \r\n\r\n#### 4. Maryland\r\nWith a PVI of D+12, Maryland is tied with California as the third-most Democratic state in the U.S. Being one of the original 13 colonies, Maryland entered the Union in 1788 and has participated in all 58 presidential elections. Maryland has voted Democratic in every presidential election since 1992, including in the most recent 2016 election where Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton beat Republican Donald Trump 60% to 34%. Maryland is expected to vote Democratic in the upcoming 2020 presidential election.\r\n\r\n#### 5. Massachusetts\r\nMassachusetts is also tied with California and Maryland for the number three spot in the most Democratic states with a PVI of D+12. Like Maryland, Massachusetts was one of the 13 colonies and joined the Union in 1788. Massachusetts has participated in every presidential election since then and has voted Democratic every election since 1928 except for four. In the most recent 2016 presidential election, Hillary Clinton easily beat Donald Trump 60% to 33%. \r\n\r\n#### 6. New York\r\nNew York is tied with California, Maryland, and Massachusetts as the third-most Democratic state in the U.S. with a PVI of D+12. New York has the third-highest number of electoral votes of 29, behind California (55) and Texas (38). New York has voted Democratic since 1988.

Six races are officially recognized in the United States: White, American Indian and Alaska Native, Asian, Black or African American, Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander. The U.S. Census Bureau also classifies Americans as âHispanic or Latinoâ and âNot Hispanic or Latino.â A âperson of colorâ is used in the United States to describe anyone who is not white. People of color, unfortunately, share the common experience of racism. \r\n\r\nAlthough the majority of the population in the United States are White Americans, the country is increasingly becoming more racially and ethnically diverse. The Hispanic population, for example, is expected to comprise one-quarter of the population by 2050. \r\n\r\nContemporary immigrants often settle in seven states: California, New York, Florida, Texas, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Illinois. About 70% of the immigrant population lives in one of these seven states.\r\n\r\nWhile racial and ethnic diversity are the primary factors of diversity, there are several other types that can be measured to give a bigger picture of overall diversity. These include economic diversity, religious diversity and political diversity. A stateâs diversity score is each stateâs weighted average across all metrics. A score of 100 represents the most diverse state. \r\n\r\nWhen all four of these are taken into account, California is the most diverse state in the United States. California is the most culturally diverse state and ranks sixth in political diversity, 11th in economic diversity, and thirty-second in religious diversity. Californiaâs total diversity score is 70.89. \r\n\r\nTexas is ranked the second most diverse state with an overall score of 70.\r\n\r\nThe least diverse state in the United States is West Virginia. West Virginia is the least culturally diverse state and ranks 19th in economic diversity, 42nd in religious diversity, and 44th in political diversity.

According to the [Global Partnership for Education](https://www.globalpartnership.org/education), education boosts economic growth, ends poverty, promotes gender equality, and promotes peace. Additionally, education is essential for achieving the [17 Global Goals]( https://www.globalpartnership.org/multimedia/infographic/education-and-global-goals), which are set out to achieve sustainable development, end extreme poverty, fight inequality and injustice, and protect our planet by 2030.\r\n\r\nEducation is the best way for people to decrease their chances of unemployment, increase their earning potential, and meet their career goals.\r\n\r\nIn the United States, 90% of the population over the age of 25 have a high school diploma and 34% have a Bachelorâs degree. The national education budget in 2016-2017 was $1.3 trillion, the majority of which came from state and local governments. The US spends more on education than any other country in the world. Education in the United States includes public schools, private schools, and approved homeschooling.\r\n\r\nState governments set education standards. Depending on the state, education is compulsory over an age range starting between five and eight up until between ages sixteen and eighteen. Additionally, states typically mandate standardized tests for K-12 public school systems.\r\n\r\nEducation varies between all 50 states in both educational attainment and quality of education. [WalletHub]( https://wallethub.com/edu/e/most-educated-states/31075/#cinda-klickna) compared these two dimensions using 20 different metrics that were given a score of 0 to 100, 100 being the âmost educated.â These metrics include the share of adults over 25 years old with a high school diploma/some college/at least a Bachelorâs degree/etc., quality of school system, public high school graduation rate, enrolled students in top universities, public college graduation rate, and more. Each stateâs weighted average across all metrics was then determined in order to rank the states.\r\n\r\n## Ten Most Educated States in the U.S.\r\n\r\n#### 1.

It is the amount of money needed to sustain a certain standard of living by affording basic expenses such as food, housing, healthcare, and taxes. \r\n\r\nCost of living is one of the big factors people use to determine where they want to be located in addition to cultural attractions, a healthy job market, and good school systems.\r\n\r\nThe cost of living in the United States varies significantly from one state to the next. The factors affecting the cost of living include the average earning, the average cost of rent or buying property, and the price of essential goods. Unfortunately, many states are unaffordable for middle-class wage earners due to slow wage growth, inflation, and expensive housing in the U.S.\r\n\r\n## Ten Most Expensive States in the United States\r\n\r\n#### 1. Hawaii\r\n\r\nHawaii is the most expensive state to live in in the United States. Hawaii has a cost index of 192.9. The average home price in Hawaii is $1,158,492 and the average monthly energy bill is $388.65. Basic physical goods, such as a half-gallon of milk, cost more than anywhere on the mainland United States because they need to be shipped to the middle of the Pacific Ocean. \r\n\r\n#### 2. District of Columbia\r\n\r\nWashington D.C. is the second-most expensive state in the United States. D.C. has expensive housing, with the average two-bedroom apartment costing $2,776 per month and the median home value at $628,914. The living wage in D.C. is $67,867, the highest living wage in the country. Luckily, D.C. has one of the highest median household incomes in the country at $85,203 per year. \r\n\r\n#### 3. California\r\n\r\nCalifornia is the third-most-expensive state in the U.S. with notoriously high housing and transportation costs. The average two-bedroom apartment in California runs for about $2,495 per month and is even more expensive in cities such as San Francisco and Los Angeles. California has some of the highest gasoline prices in the United States and the average monthly energy bill is about $237.13. \r\n\r\n#### 4. New York\r\n\r\nNew York is the fourth-most expensive state in the United States. New York has the most expensive housing, with the average cost of a home at $1,901,222. Rent in New York is also known to be one of the highest in the country with an average rent of $3,667. The closer one lives to New York City, the more expensive it is to live in the state. The living wage in New York is $59,128 and the median household income is $64,894. \r\n\r\n#### 5. Oregon\r\n\r\nOregon is the fifth-most expensive state in the country. Oregonâs median home value is $549,358, more than double the U.S. median. Groceries in Oregon are also more expensive than the U.S. average, especially coffee and sugar. Transportation costs in Oregon are the third-highest in the country behind Hawaii and California. Luckily, utility costs are below-average. \r\n\r\n#### 6. Massachusetts\r\n\r\nThe sixth-most expensive state in the U.S. is Massachusetts, which is home to Boston, one of the most expensive cities in the United State. The average home price in Massachusetts is $663,942; almost three times the national average. Massachusetts residentsâ monthly energy bill is around $236.62 on average and their gas prices are fairly high as well. Luckily, as the most educated state in the U.S., Massachusetts also has one of the highest median household incomes in the country of $77,378. \r\n\r\n#### 7. Alaska\r\n\r\nAlaska is the U.S.âs seventh most expensive state. Like Hawaii, Alaska also needs to have all of its goods shipped in from the mainland United States and is separated from the mainland by Canada. Additionally, Alaskaâs winters are cold and dark, causing energy bills to be very high. Luckily, Alaskaâs median household income is $76,715, the sixth-highest in the country, and Alaska residents receive oil dividends to help boost their income. \r\n\r\n#### 8. Maryland\r\n\r\nThe eighth-most expensive state in the United States is Maryland. Marylandâs expensiveness can be attributed to its proximity to Washington D.C. The average home price in Maryland is $794,750. Despite the cost, Maryland has the second-lowest poverty rate in the U.S. of 8.2%. Additionally, Maryland has the second-highest median household income of $81,868.\r\n\r\n#### 9. Connecticut\r\n\r\nConnecticut is the ninth-most expensive state in the United States. Connecticut has expensive housing, utilities, and alcohol. The average home price in Connecticut is $662,447 and the monthly energy bill for a home is about $215.97. Additionally, a bottle of white table wine in the state will cost about $10.63 on average, which is double the price than in other states. Grocery prices are also above average. \r\n\r\n#### 10. New Jersey\r\n\r\nNew Jersey rounds out the ten most expensive states in the U.S. New Jersey is especially expensive the closer one lives to New York City, specifically in Bergen and Passaic counties. The average home price in New Jersey is $578,386 and the average one-bedroom apartment costs $1,242, higher than the national average. Coupled with high property values, New Jersey also has the highest property tax rate in the country of 2.44%. New Jersey residents help pay for this cost of living with the third-highest median household income in the country of $79,363 per year.\r\n\r\nAt the opposite end, Mississippi, Arkansas, and Oklahoma are the least expensive states. In general, however, states where it is cheaper to live have lower median incomes. In 2017, the median household income in Mississippi was $43,529 but the US median was $60,336.\r\n\r\nBelow is a table of each state in order of cost of living.

While this is seen as a political exercise, in some instances, state legislators and governors control the redistricting and use this to give their political party an advantage over their opponents. \n \nGerrymandering first occurred when minorities were given the right to vote. Legislative bodies used gerrymandering to ensure that the political power of these voters was diminished. Today, gerrymandering may occur for a variety of reasons, although there have been proposals for ways to prevent this from occurring.

Additionally, the chances of inheriting genetic disease significantly increase among children who are the result of inbreeding. \r\n\r\n[Researchers from the University of Queensland](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/d-brief/2019/09/03/inbreeding-study-uk-biobank-health-risks/#.XcHkj5JKhTY) observed 450,000 genomes from people of European descent born between 1938 and 1967. Out of the group, 125 people met the criteria for inbreeding, meaning the parents were either first-degree relatives (siblings) or second-degree relatives (aunts, uncles, etc.). In this group, researchers found common health issues such as decreased cognitive abilities and muscular function, reduced height and lung function, and a greater risk of contracting diseases in general. \r\n\r\nWhile inbreeding is incredibly taboo in the United States, it is somewhat legal in some states. While not widely practiced, first cousin marriage is legal in 19 states and some first-cousin marriages are legal in seven states. Sexual relations and cohabitation are only prohibited in nine states. Approximately 0.2% of all marriages in the United States are between second cousins or closer. That means that there are about 250,000 Americans that are in these relationships. \r\n\r\nInbreeding is more common in the following states:\r\n\r\n-\tWashington\r\n-\tOregon\r\n-\tMontana\r\n-\tSouth Dakota\r\n-\tNew Mexico\r\n-\tOklahoma\r\n-\tArkansas\r\n-\tLouisiana\r\n-\tIndiana\r\n-\tKentucky\r\n-\tTennessee\r\n-\tAlabama\r\n-\tGeorgia\r\n-\tSouth Carolina\r\n-\tNorth Carolina\r\n-\tVirginia\r\n-\tWest Virginia\r\n-\tMaryland\r\n-\tDelaware\r\n-\tMaine\r\n\r\nGenerally, inbreeding is more common in, the southeast region of the U.S. and more rural states. Approximately 70% of inbred families live in desolate areas.\r\n\r\nInbreeding is common specifically in the eastern part of Kentucky and the region is plagued by the stereotype that every family is an inbred family. While the stereotype is not entirely true, inbreeding rates are higher in eastern Kentucky than in any other part of the state. It is believed that this is partially because people have moved to the mountains in eastern Kentucky for the low cost of living and the lifestyle, but there are typically no other families living in these locations. The families that move there either donât have the money to leave or do not want to leave, and the growing children typically inbreed to save their family name. \r\n\r\nOne family from Kentucky known for generations of inbreeding is the Fugate family. The Fugate family was relatively isolated from the rest of society for nearly 200 years. The result of their inbreeding led to several medical problems and recessive genes being passed down through each child, such as one that gave some of the offspring blue skin. The blue skin gene is a recessive gene that only appears when both parents are carriers of the gene. The inbreeding caused the recessive gene to appear in both parents.\r\n","sources":[{"name":"Inbreeding by State","link":"https://www.targetmap.com/viewer.aspx?reportId=6749"}],"lastModified":"2020-04-06T20:09:05.164Z","path":"most-inbred-states","name":"Most Inbred States"},{"article":"âBlue statesâ are states that have a more liberal population and culture, as opposed to the conservative âred states.â While there are many more red states than blue states, the blue states tend to have much higher populations, so they have higher numbers in indexes like the electoral college and the number of congressional representatives. \n\nThere are also neutral states, usually referred to as âswing statesâ because these states could go either Democrat or Republican in an election. Candidates typically do most of their campaigning in the swing states, which include Pennsylvania, Virginia, Wisconsin, Michigan, Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, Colorado, Nevada, and Florida.\n\nThe most liberal state in the country is Massachusetts, where the equally progressive city of Boston is located. Next is Hawaii, followed by Vermont, Washington, New York, New Hampshire, California, Maryland, New Jersey, and Maine. This index of how liberal a state is is based on how many liberals there are, as compared to conservatives. \n\nJust like some states can be more liberal than others, some cities are more liberal than others. These cities tend to have high minority populations and public expressions of LGBTQ+ acceptance. The most liberal city in the country is San Francisco, California, followed by Washington, DC; Seattle, Washington; Oakland, California; Boston, Massachusetts; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Detroit, Michigan; New York City, New York; Buffalo, New York; and Baltimore, Maryland. Notice that all of these cities are in blue states.\n\nStates can change from liberal to conservative over time due to factors like immigration, empowerment of minority groups (which tend to support liberal policies over conservative ones), and taxation. New York, for example, used to be highly conservative but is now much more progressive.\n\nBelow are the ten most liberal states in the United States. The data is based on a 2018 Gallup pull. \n\n#### 1. Massachusetts\n\nMassachusetts is the most liberal state in the U.S. with 35% of voters identifying as liberal. With 21% of voters identifying as conservative, Massachusetts has a liberal advantage of 14 points. Moderates are the largest group in Massachusetts, with 38% of the voting population identifying as moderate. In the 2016 presidential election, 60% of voters voted Democratic. \n\nMassachusetts is also the home state of well-known politicians such as Elizabeth Warren, Michael Dukakis, Jill Stein, and the Kennedyâs. That state also has a high number of urban areas and a highly educated population â two factors that strongly contribute to a liberal environment. \n\n#### 2. Maine\n\nMaine is the second-most liberal state in the country. 33% of voters identify as liberal; however, the liberal advantage is -2 because 35% of voters identify as conservative. In the 2016 presidential election, 47.9% of Maine voted Democratic, while 44.9% voted Republican. Maine is one of the few states where moderates do not outnumber liberals or conservatives, with 29% of voters identifying as moderate. \n\n#### 3. Vermont\n\nVermont is the third-most liberal state in the country with 32% of voters identifying as liberal. With 28% of voters identifying as conservative, Vermont has a liberal advantage of 4 points, the third-highest in the country. 56.3% of Vermont voters voted Democratic in the 2016 election while 30.3% voted Republican.

Obesity is when an adult has a BMI of 30 or greater.  According to the Centers for Disease Control, 39.8% of Americans were obese in 2015-2016, approximately 93 million people.\n\nBodyweight is the result of several factors such as overeating, lack of physical activity, genetics, culture, and metabolism. \n\nObesity is linked to many health complications and diseases, such as early death, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, certain types of cancer, and stroke.\n\nThere are some groups with higher obesity rates, according to the CDC. Men and women with college degrees overall had lower obesity prevalence than those who did not have a higher education. Hispanics and non-Hispanic blacks had the highest prevalence of obesity, at 47.0% and 46.8%, respectively. The prevalence of obesity was highest among middle-aged adults, ages 40-59 years old, at 42.8%.\n\nAccording to a 2017 report by Consumer Protect, the state with the highest obesity rate is West Virginia, with a reported 38.1% of the state being obese. West Virginia also has the highest diabetes rate in the United States. Mississippi has the second-highest obesity rate at 37.3% and also has the shortest life expectancy among all of the states at 74.7 years. \n\nConsumer Protect also released a Couch Potato Index, which ranks the 50 states by the percentage of adults who participate in zero physical activity according to the CDC. Mississippi is second on this list, with 33.2% of adults engaging in zero physical activity. West Virginia ranks number eight on this list at 31.6%.\n\nThe least obese state in the United States is Colorado, with 22.6% of its inhabitants considered obese. This is attributed to the outdoors and activities associated with being outside, as well as better eating habits. The District of Columbia and Hawaii boasts the second and third lowest rates, at 23.0% and 23.8% respectively. Hawaii also has the highest life expectancy in the United States at 81.3 years.

A racist person believes that his or her race is superior, while other races are inferior.\n\nRacism in a given area isnât something that can be measured like population or area.

Other data such as instances of hate crimes and hate speech can also be used to determine where racism is most prevalent.\n\nBecause of this, itâs difficult to measure what states in the U.S. are the most racist. However, some organizations and publications have attempted to measure racism throughout the United States. The following contains some of these findings.\n\nThe apartment search website Abodo created a map outlining the most racist areas in the nation. The site used software that tracked over 12 million tweets posted in 2014 and 2016, filtering out tweets with racial slurs.\n\n\u003e Based on these findings, West Virginia was revealed to be the most racist state.

Based on this data, the study found that the most racist regions in the United States are the rural Northeast and South. Searches containing racial slurs were most prevalent in the Appalachian region from Georgia to New York and Vermont. High concentrations of racist searches were discovered in areas along the Gulf Coast, the Upper Peninsula region in Michigan, and the state of Ohio.\n\nIt is important to note, however, that these findings arenât an official ranking of racist states.

Although there are many different religions, most are centered around the belief that there is a higher power. Some regions around the world are very religious, while others arenât as much so. In the United States, there are some states that are more religious than other states. \n\nThere is not a comprehensive way to determine what states are the most religious. However, Pew Research Centerâs Religious Landscape Study gives us the best picture of what states are the most religious. \n\nThis study looks at four measures to determine what states are the most religious. These four measures include: \n\n- Religious attendance\n- Frequency of prayer\n- Belief in God\n- Self-assessment of the importance of religion\n\nBased on these measures, two states were determined to be the most religious. Both Alabama and Mississippi came on top. In each state, 77% of residents were believed to be âhighly religious.â We can also take a look at the individual factors that contributed to this overall score. \n\nSeventy-seven percent of residents in Alabama stated that religion was very important within their own lives, compared to just 74% of people who said the same in Mississippi. Mississippi topped Alabama when it came to prayers, with 75% of the people of Mississippi stating they pray daily compared to just 73% of people in Alabama. \n\nWhen it comes to attending worship services, neither Alabama nor Mississippi came out on top. That honor went to the state of Utah, where 53% of residents attend worship services at least weekly. Alabama came in second place with 51% of residents regularly attending services, while Mississippi came in 4th with 49%. \n\nFor belief in God, both states were tied. Eighty-two percent of people in each state believe in God with absolute certainty. \n\nThese two states arenât the only ones that are very religious, though. In Tennessee, 73% of adults are seen as âhighly religiousâ based on the four measures. Louisiana is also very religious with an overall score of 71%. Arkansas and South Carolina are tied for 5th place with scores of 70%. \n\nThe top 10 most religious states in the United States are as follows: \n\n- Alabama\n- Mississippi\n- Tennessee\n- Louisiana\n- Arkansas\n- South Carolina\n- West Virginia\n- Georgia\n- Oklahoma\n- North Carolina\n\n","data":{"states":["Alabama","Mississippi","Tennessee","Louisiana","Arkansas","South Carolina","West Virginia","Georgia","Oklahoma","North Carolina"],"customMeta":{"columns":["state",{"header":"Religious Rank","field":"religiousRank"},{"header":"Religious Adults","field":"religiousAdults","format":"perc"},"population"],"sortField":"religiousRank","sortAsc":true,"showAllStates":true,"chloroMap":{"field":"religiousAdults"},"relatedArticles":["amish-population","bible-belt-states","jewish-population-by-state","least-religious-states","most-religious-states","muslim-population-by-state","mormon-population-by-state"]},"customData":[{"religiousAdults":0.77,"state":"Alabama","religiousRank":1},{"religiousAdults":0.77,"state":"Mississippi","religiousRank":1},{"religiousAdults":0.73,"state":"Tennessee","religiousRank":3},{"religiousAdults":0.71,"state":"Louisiana","religiousRank":4},{"religiousAdults":0.7,"state":"Arkansas","religiousRank":5},{"religiousAdults":0.7,"state":"South Carolina","religiousRank":5},{"religiousAdults":0.69,"state":"West Virginia","religiousRank":7},{"religiousAdults":0.66,"state":"Georgia","religiousRank":8},{"religiousAdults":0.66,"state":"Oklahoma","religiousRank":8},{"religiousAdults":0.65,"state":"North Carolina","religiousRank":10},{"religiousAdults":0.64,"state":"Texas","religiousRank":11},{"religiousAdults":0.64,"state":"Utah","religiousRank":11},{"religiousAdults":0.63,"state":"Kentucky","religiousRank":13},{"religiousAdults":0.61,"state":"Virginia","religiousRank":14},{"religiousAdults":0.6,"state":"Missouri","religiousRank":15},{"religiousAdults":0.59,"state":"South Dakota","religiousRank":16},{"religiousAdults":0.58,"state":"Ohio","religiousRank":17},{"religiousAdults":0.57,"state":"New Mexico","religiousRank":18},{"religiousAdults":0.55,"state":"Iowa","religiousRank":19},{"religiousAdults":0.55,"state":"Kansas","religiousRank":19},{"religiousAdults":0.55,"state":"New Jersey","religiousRank":19},{"religiousAdults":0.54,"state":"Florida","religiousRank":22},{"religiousAdults":0.54,"state":"Indiana","religiousRank":22},{"religiousAdults":0.54,"state":"Maryland","religiousRank":22},{"religiousAdults":0.54,"state":"Nebraska","religiousRank":22},{"religiousAdults":0.54,"state":"Wyoming","religiousRank":22},{"religiousAdults":0.53,"state":"Arizona","religiousRank":27},{"religiousAdults":0.53,"state":"District of Columbia","religiousRank":27},{"religiousAdults":0.53,"state":"Michigan","religiousRank":27},{"religiousAdults":0.53,"state":"North Dakota","religiousRank":27},{"religiousAdults":0.53,"state":"Pennsylvania","religiousRank":27},{"religiousAdults":0.52,"state":"Delaware","religiousRank":32},{"religiousAdults":0.51,"state":"Idaho","religiousRank":33},{"religiousAdults":0.51,"state":"Illinois","religiousRank":33},{"religiousAdults":0.49,"state":"California","religiousRank":35},{"religiousAdults":0.49,"state":"Minnesota","religiousRank":35},{"religiousAdults":0.49,"state":"Nevada","religiousRank":35},{"religiousAdults":0.49,"state":"Rhode Island","religiousRank":35},{"religiousAdults":0.48,"state":"Montana","religiousRank":39},{"religiousAdults":0.48,"state":"Oregon","religiousRank":39},{"religiousAdults":0.47,"state":"Colorado","religiousRank":41},{"religiousAdults":0.47,"state":"Hawaii","religiousRank":41},{"religiousAdults":0.46,"state":"New York","religiousRank":43},{"religiousAdults":0.45,"state":"Alaska","religiousRank":44},{"religiousAdults":0.45,"state":"Washington","religiousRank":44},{"religiousAdults":0.45,"state":"Wisconsin","religiousRank":44},{"religiousAdults":0.43,"state":"Connecticut","religiousRank":47},{"religiousAdults":0.34,"state":"Maine","religiousRank":48},{"religiousAdults":0.34,"state":"Vermont","religiousRank":48},{"religiousAdults":0.33,"state":"Massachusetts","religiousRank":50},{"religiousAdults":0.33,"state":"New Hampshire","religiousRank":50}]},"sources":[{"name":"Most Religious States in America","link":"https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/02/29/how-religious-is-your-state/?state=alabama"}],"lastModified":"2020-04-06T20:09:05.164Z","path":"most-religious-states","name":"Most Religious States"},{"article":"Across the nation, U.S. citizens have different political beliefs. Some citizens lean more to the right â or Republican â with conservative values, while others lean more to the left and support the more liberal Democratic party.\n\nWhile some states are pretty closely divided, there are others where the majority of residents support one party. One of the ways that this is measured is through the Cook Partisan Voting Index, also known as the CPVI. This measures how strongly a state leans toward one party of the other when compared to the entire nation. Following each election, this index is updated to provide the most accurate results.\n\nCPVIs are calculated by taking a look at the average Democratic or Republican share of the last two presidential elections compared to the national average. Results of the CPVI are broken down by congressional district and by state. By using this data, you can quickly determine which states are more Republican or more Democratic.\n\nBased on the latest CPVI data, Wyoming is the most Republican state in the nation.

The reports are often published in the late fall of the following year. So, the FBI Criminal Report in terms of the murder rates by state for 2017 was published and released for public viewing in September of 2018. The reports detailing the homicide rates by state for the previous year of 2018 have not yet been compiled, but you can expect to read the data for 2018 in the fall of 2019. \n\nAll that said, the murder rates per state in 2017 are as follows. Note that each data point reflects the number of people who were murdered in a given state per 100,000 people. As an example, Alabamaâs murder rate in 2017 is a value of 12.9, meaning that for every 100,000 residents of Alabama, there are nearly 13 deaths caused by homicide. \n\nBy taking the stateâs population, dividing that value by 100,000 people, and then multiplying it by the [murder rate](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/sosmap/homicide_mortality/homicide.htm), you can figure out a closer estimation of the annual murder rates per state. The murder rates by state in 2017 are in the table below.\n\nThe United States experienced one of the lowest [murder rates](https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/murder-rates-nationally-and-state) by state in a given year back in 2010. To see how the most recent calculations of the murder rates by states in America, take a look at these values below. They represent the murder rates by state in 2010, and you can see the way that murder rates have heightened between 2017 and 2010.\n\nMurder Rate by State\n\n#### States with the Highest Murder Rates\n\nLouisiana has the highest murder rate in the U.S. of 14.4 murders per 100,000 residents. Murders were more than twice as common in Louisiana as they were nationwide. Murders are disproportionately concentrated in urban areas, especially New Orleans. New Orleans has a murder rate of about 37 per 100,000 residents, one of the highest of any U.S. city, followed by Baton Rouge with a murder rate of 35.1.\n\nAlabama has the second-highest murder rate of 12.9 murders per 100,000 residents. This is also more than twice the rate nationwide. In Alabama, Birmingham has the most gun violence and, therefore, the highest murder rate of 37.1. Fairfield, Anniston, Pritchard, and Troy are other cities with the highest murder rates in Alabama. \n\nMississippi has the third-highest murder rate in the United States. Mississippiâs murder rate is 12.7 murders per 100,000 residents. According to the latest FBI data, Jackson had the most murders in 2018 of 78, which is a murder rate of 47 murders per 100,000 residents. Brookhaven has the highest murder rate in the state of 57.7 murders per 100,000 people. \n\nMissouri has the fourth-highest murder rate of 11.3 murders per 100,000 residents. Murders in Missouri are disproportionately concentrated in metropolitan areas â about 90% of murders committed in 2017 in Missouri were committed in metropolitan areas. St. Louis and Kansas City are two of the most dangerous cities in the United States. In 2017, St. Louis had 205 murders and Kansas City had 150.\n\nAlaska has the fifth-highest murder rate in the U.S. with a rate of 10.6 murders per 100,000 residents. Alaska has the highest violent crime rate of any state of 829 incidents per 100,000 residents. The most dangerous city in Alaska is Anchorage, where the violent crime rate is 1,203 per 100,000 residents and 27 people were murdered in 2017. \n\n#### States with the Lowest Murder Rates\n\nNorth Dakota, Vermont, New Hampshire, Maine, Rhode Island, and Wyoming all have murder rates that are under one murder per 100,000 residents. \n\nNorth Dakota had a total of 15 murder deaths in 2017. The state also has the 14th lowest violent crime rate in the country and the ninth-lowest incarceration rate. The state is generally one of the safest; however, it has one of the highest suicide rates in the country. \n\nVermont also had only 15 murder deaths in 2017. With the second-lowest violent crime rate in the country of 165.8 incidents per 100,000 people and the second-lowest number of assaults per capita, Vermont is considered to be the second-safest state all around. \n\nNew Hampshire had a total of 17 murders in 2017. New Hampshire has the fourth-fewest assaults per capita and is considered to be the sixth-safest state in the U.S. New Hampshire also has the third-lowest violent crime rate in the country of 198.7 per 100,000 residents. \n\nMaine has the lowest murder rate in the United States with less than 1 murder per 100,000 residents. Maine had a total of 19 murders in 2017. Maine is also the [third-safest state](http://worldpopulationreview.com/states/safest-states/) in the United States with the lowest number of assaults per capita of any state. Some of the safest cities in Maine are Sabattus, Cape Elizabeth, Cumberland, and Eliot.\n\nRhode Island also had a total of 19 murders. Rhode Island is considered to be the [most peaceful state](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/07/16/americas-most-violent-and-peaceful-states/39672421/) in the United States. Violent crimes are relatively uncommon in Rhode Island with a rate of 232.2 incidents per 100,000 residents, the ninth-lowest in the country.\n\nWyoming had only 19 murders in 2017 as well. Wyoming has the smallest population of any state in the U.S. and they say that with a small population comes a small crime rate. The safest cities in Wyoming are Kemmerer, Glenrock, and Worland. \n\n\n","data":{"states":[],"customMeta":{"note":"Rate is number of homicides per 100,000 population.","columns":["state",{"header":"2017 Homicide Rate","field":"rate"},{"header":"Total 2017 Homicides","field":"deaths","format":"numberWithCommas"},{"header":"2010 Homicide Rate","field":"2010rate"}],"sortField":"rate","sortAsc":false,"showAllStates":true,"isFixed":true,"tileMap":{"field":"rate"},"scatterChartFields":[{"field":"rate","title":"2017 Rate","label":"Per 100,000 People"},{"field":"2010rate","title":"2010 Rate","label":"Per 100,000 People"}],"relatedArticles":["abortion-rates-by-state","birth-rate-by-state","crime-rate-by-state","depression-rates-by-state","employment-rate-by-state","labor-force-participation-rate-by-state","murder-rate-by-state","suicide-rates-by-state","teen-pregnancy-rates-by-state","unemployment-rate-by-state","us-literacy-rates-by-state"]},"customData":[{"state":"Alabama","rate":12.9,"2010rate":5.7,"deaths":602},{"state":"Alaska","rate":10.6,"2010rate":4.3,"deaths":78},{"state":"Arizona","rate":6.6,"2010rate":6.4,"deaths":441},{"state":"Arkansas","rate":9.8,"2010rate":4.6,"deaths":278},{"state":"California","rate":5.1,"2010rate":4.8,"deaths":2022},{"state":"Colorado","rate":4.6,"2010rate":2.6,"deaths":261},{"state":"Connecticut","rate":3.2,"2010rate":3.7,"deaths":109},{"state":"Delaware","rate":6.9,"2010rate":5.7,"deaths":63},{"state":"Florida","rate":6.4,"2010rate":5.2,"deaths":1269},{"state":"Georgia","rate":7.9,"2010rate":5.7,"deaths":810},{"state":"Hawaii","rate":2.5,"2010rate":1.8,"deaths":35},{"state":"Idaho","rate":3,"2010rate":1.4,"deaths":50},{"state":"Illinois","rate":9,"2010rate":5.5,"deaths":1120},{"state":"Indiana","rate":7.2,"2010rate":4.1,"deaths":456},{"state":"Iowa","rate":3.4,"2010rate":1.2,"deaths":104},{"state":"Kansas","rate":6.5,"2010rate":3.4,"deaths":185},{"state":"Kentucky","rate":7.3,"2010rate":4.3,"deaths":310},{"state":"Louisiana","rate":14.4,"2010rate":11,"deaths":653},{"state":"Maine","rate":1.4,"2010rate":1.8,"deaths":19},{"state":"Maryland","rate":10.2,"2010rate":7.4,"deaths":587},{"state":"Massachusetts","rate":2.6,"2010rate":3.3,"deaths":171},{"state":"Michigan","rate":6.3,"2010rate":5.9,"deaths":588},{"state":"Minnesota","rate":2.2,"2010rate":1.8,"deaths":122},{"state":"Mississippi","rate":12.7,"2010rate":6.9,"deaths":360},{"state":"Missouri","rate":11.3,"2010rate":7,"deaths":655},{"state":"Montana","rate":4.3,"2010rate":2.5,"deaths":42},{"state":"Nebraska","rate":2.7,"2010rate":3,"deaths":50},{"state":"Nevada","rate":7.6,"2010rate":5.8,"deaths":221},{"state":"New Hampshire","rate":1.2,"2010rate":1,"deaths":17},{"state":"New Jersey","rate":4.1,"2010rate":4.2,"deaths":352},{"state":"New Mexico","rate":8.5,"2010rate":6.8,"deaths":173},{"state":"New York","rate":3,"2010rate":4.5,"deaths":577},{"state":"North Carolina","rate":6.9,"2010rate":5,"deaths":679},{"state":"North Dakota","rate":2,"2010rate":1.5,"deaths":15},{"state":"Ohio","rate":7.5,"2010rate":4.2,"deaths":828},{"state":"Oklahoma","rate":8.5,"2010rate":5.2,"deaths":318},{"state":"Oregon","rate":3.1,"2010rate":2.5,"deaths":127},{"state":"Pennsylvania","rate":6.6,"2010rate":5.1,"deaths":791},{"state":"Rhode Island","rate":1.8,"2010rate":2.8,"deaths":19},{"state":"South Carolina","rate":9.3,"2010rate":5.7,"deaths":444},{"state":"South Dakota","rate":4.2,"2010rate":2.8,"deaths":34},{"state":"Tennessee","rate":8.8,"2010rate":5.6,"deaths":557},{"state":"Texas","rate":5.8,"2010rate":4.9,"deaths":1653},{"state":"Utah","rate":2.6,"2010rate":1.9,"deaths":79},{"state":"Vermont","rate":2.4,"2010rate":1.1,"deaths":15},{"state":"Virginia","rate":5.4,"2010rate":4.7,"deaths":455},{"state":"Washington","rate":3.6,"2010rate":2.3,"deaths":266},{"state":"West Virginia","rate":6.5,"2010rate":3.1,"deaths":112},{"state":"Wisconsin","rate":3.7,"2010rate":2.7,"deaths":202},{"state":"Wyoming","rate":3.4,"2010rate":1.4,"deaths":19}]},"sources":[{"name":"Homicide Mortality by State","link":"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/sosmap/homicide_mortality/homicide.htm"}],"lastModified":"2020-04-06T20:09:05.164Z","path":"murder-rate-by-state","name":"Murder Rate By State"},{"article":"Psilocybin mushrooms, known as magic mushrooms or âshrooms,â are mushrooms that contain a naturally occurring psychoactive and hallucinogenic compound called psilocybin. \r\n\r\nMagic mushrooms can cause altered or unusual perceptions of their reality, causing users to see, hear, and feel sensations that seem real but are not. Magic mushrooms have long been associated with spiritual experiences and self-discovery; however, a âbad tripâ can cause the user to experience anxiety, paranoia, frightening hallucinations, and psychosis. \r\n\r\nWhen psilocybin enters the body, it becomes psilocin. Psilocin binds with serotonin receptors in the brain, specifically the 5-HT2C receptor regulating neurotransmitter chemicals that control feelings of appetite, cognition, anxiety, imagination, mood, and perception.\r\n\r\nPsilocybin is classified as a Schedule I drug. Schedule I drugs have a high potential for misuse and have no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States. In 2018, however, researchers at Johns Hopkins University suggested reclassification of magic mushrooms to a Schedule IV drug for medical use. The researchers suggested that they could help treat depression, anxiety, and substance use disorders.\r\n\r\nMagic mushrooms are currently legal in Brazil, Bulgaria, Jamaica, the Netherlands, and Samoa. Many other countries have decriminalized the possession and cultivation of mushrooms and some countries considered mushrooms only in dried form to be illegal. \r\n\r\nIn the United States, however, magic mushrooms are still illegal in all 50 states. Denver, Colorado and Oakland, California have both signed legislation to decriminalize magic mushrooms opening the door for researchers to explore potential medical benefits. Oakland City Council Member Noel Gallo stated that magic mushrooms have long been used âfor providing healing, knowledge, creativity, and spiritual connection.â \r\n\r\nWhile the recreational use of magic mushrooms is still illegal across the United States, activists in some states are pushing for more widespread decriminalization. A 2020 Oregon ballot initiative could make mushrooms legal under licensed, therapeutic conditions. As more research continues on the medical and therapeutic benefits of magic mushrooms, the United States could see a gradual change in their legality.\r\n\r\n","data":{"customMeta":{"relatedArticles":["abortion-laws-by-state","blue-laws-by-state","child-discipline-laws-by-state","clothing-laws-by-state","common-law-marriage-states","filial-responsibility-laws-by-state","final-paycheck-laws-by-state","gun-laws-by-state","helmet-law-states","homeschool-laws-by-state","incest-laws-by-state","late-fee-laws-by-state","magazine-capacity-laws-by-state","marijuana-laws-by-state","mushroom-laws-by-state","pepper-spray-laws-by-state","seat-belt-laws-by-state","states-with-stand-your-ground-laws","tiny-house-laws-by-state","voter-id-laws-by-state"]}},"sources":[{"name":"States Consider Decriminalizing Magic Mushrooms","link":"https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/articles/2019-06-14/states-consider-decriminalizing-magic-mushrooms"}],"lastModified":"2020-04-06T20:09:05.164Z","path":"mushroom-laws-by-state","name":"Mushroom Laws By State"},{"article":"Islam is an Abrahamic, monotheistic faith regarded as revealed through Muhammad as the Prophet of Allah. Islamâs religious text is the Quran, believed by Muslims to be the verbatim words of God and the teachings and normative examples of Muhammad. \r\n\r\nIslam is the worldâs second-largest religion with over 1.9 billion followers known as Muslims. Islam is the worldâs fastest-growing religion, and is forecasted to grow at a faster rate than Christianity by 2050.\r\n\r\nIslam is the third-largest religion in the United States after Christianity and Judaism. There are a total of 3.45 million Muslims in the United States, according to a 2017 study, comprising about 1.1% of the total US population. American Muslims are one of the most racially diverse religious groups in the US with no majority race, split as 25% black, 24% white, 18% Asian, 18% Arab, 7% mixed race, and 5% Hispanic.\r\n\r\nIt is unclear when Islam first arrived to the United States. Approximately 10-20% of slaves brought to colonial America arrived as Muslims, but were suppressed on plantations. During the 20th century, the United States saw the largest increase in the Muslim population.

The state with the highest number of national parks is California, with a total of 9, followed by Alaska with 8.\n\nThe first national park in the United States was Yellowstone, which was signed to its status in 1872 by President Ulysses S.

New England is the oldest region of the United States. The Puritans originally established it as the Plymouth Colony in the 1600s. These Puritans came to America to leave behind the religious persecution they faced in England. The Plymouth Colony was the first in the New England region and the second colony of the United States.\n\nTribes originally inhabited the region includes the Penobscots, Pequots, and Abenaki â to name a few. As more Puritans came from England, the Massachusetts Bay Colony was established in 1629. In the 1630s, Providence Plantations was created and later merged with settlements to form the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations. The Connecticut Colony was established in the 1630s.\n\nToday, the region is still known as New England. As previously mentioned, there are six states in the area. Those states are:\n\n- Connecticut\n- Maine\n- Massachusetts\n- New Hampshire\n- Rhode Island\n- Vermont\n\nAccording to estimates in 2017, there are over 14.8 million residents in New England.

Some advocates of marijuana believe that the plant has medicinal properties that can help with everything from insomnia to relieving pain. Other advocates are for recreational use, stating that marijuana is safer than alcohol, which is currently legal in all 50 states.\n\nOn the flip side, opponents of legalizing marijuana believe that this illegal drug is just a gateway to harder drugs like crack cocaine and heroin. Some people think that medical marijuana is okay but disagree with recreational marijuana. No matter what side of the issue you stand on, the fact remains that states are taking action to legalize marijuana.\n\nAs of January 2019, medical marijuana is legal in 33 U.S. states plus Washington, D.C. Recreational marijuana is legal in 11 states, plus Washington, D.C. Thirteen additional states have decriminalized recreational marijuana, meaning that those caught with marijuana donât receive jail time but may be fined, lose their drivers license, or face other smaller penalties.\n\nItâs only a matter of time before more states legalize marijuana, either for medical or recreational use or for both purposes. Currently, multiple states that still have laws against marijuana have seen bills introduced, and advocates stand up to have marijuana legalized. With so many people coming forward in support of marijuana, you canât help but wonder which states will be the next to legalize its use.\n\n## States That Could Legalize Weed in 2020\n\n#### New Jersey\n\nIn December 2019, lawmakers voted to put a legalization question on the 2020 ballot. State Senator Nicholas Scutari introduced the New Jersey Marijuana legalization, which passed in November 2018; however, its progress was stagnant because lawmakers disagreed on details of legalization, such as tax rate and regulatory oversight. In March 2019, it collapsed after making no progress.\n\nA [Monmouth University Poll](https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/reports/monmouthpoll_NJ_021819/) found that 62% of New Jersey adults currently support legalizing possession of small amounts of marijuana for personal use. Given this, the measure is likely to be approved by voters. Three-quarters of the public surveyed also support the opportunity for those with past drug possession convictions to expunge their records. \n\n#### New York\n\nGovernor Andrew Cuomo is strongly pushing for marijuana legalization in New York in 2020. The plan would legalize and tax marijuana, as well as pour money into the minority communities that were impacted by the War on Drugs. When similar legislation was proposed in 2019, it met surprising opposition from progressive activists who believed that the measure did not help the minority communities enough. \n\nIn June 2019, New York passed legislation that [decriminalized possession of small amounts of marijuana](https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/459468-marijuana-is-now-officially-decriminalized-in-new-york) and expunged prior convictions. This alone is historic for New York and puts the state in the right direction towards the legalization of recreational marijuana. \n\n#### Vermont\n\nVermont legalized possession and cultivation of marijuana for adults 21 and older in 2018. In February 2019, the Vermont Senate passed S.54 to regulate and tax the sale of marijuana and in May 2019, the House Government Operations Committee approved it. The House, however, adjourned in May without bringing the bill to a vote. \n\nIn 2020, the House resumed working on S.54 early in 2020 and is expected to vote on it in February. \n\n#### Arizona\n\nIn 2016, Arizona voters narrowly rejected a marijuana legalization measure with 48.7% support.\n\nThe Arizona Marijuana Legalization Initiative, referred to as the Smart and Safe Act, would legalize the possession, consumption, cultivation, and sale of marijuana to people over 21 and would tax sales at 16%. The Smart and Safe Act will appear on the 2020 ballot if a minimum of 237,645 valid voter signatures is obtained by July 2, 2020. According to a survey conducted by OH Predictive Insights, [a poll](https://ohpredictive.com/press-releases/marijuana_legalization/) shows support of legalization by a 50 to 40 margin, with 10% undecided. \n\n#### Florida\n\nFlorida voters will not be voting to legalize recreational marijuana in 2020. [Make It Legal Florida](https://makeitlegalflorida.com/), the group leading the efforts to get a constitutional amendment for recreational marijuana, announced in January of 2020 that they received more than 700,000 signed petitions to bring adult-use marijuana to Florida; however, they are pushing their efforts to get the bill on the 2022 ballot now. Make It Legal needed 700,000 verified signatures by February 1st, but the timeframe to get them verified was too small and the group only had 295,072 verified by mid-January. \n\nMake It Legal Florida is now setting its focus on getting an amendment on the ballot for the 2022.\n\n#### Arkansas\n\nIn 2016, Arkansas voters passed a medical marijuana amendment. The Arkansas Adult-Use Cannabis Amendment proposal would legalize and regulate recreational marijuana for adults over 21 and tax revenue from marijuana sales. The proposal must gather 89,151 signatures by July 3, 2020, in order to appear on the 2020 ballot. \n\nThere is also a separate expungement measure where people with prior marijuana convictions would be able to appeal to courts for release from incarceration, reduction of remaining sentences, and restoration of voting rights. \n\n#### Connecticut\n\nGovernor Ned Lamont has made it clear that he wants a push for marijuana legalization in 2020. In March and April 2019, three legislative committees in Connecticut legalized bills to legalize, regulate, and tax cannabis; however, the legislature adjourned in June without bringing them to a vote. \n\nIn a coordinated regional approach to marijuana, Governor Lamontâs approach to marijuana legalization is similar to New York Governor Cuomoâs approach, including measures to right the wrongs of a war on drugs that has devastated minority communities. Governor Lamontâs Adult-Use Cannabis Regulation Bill can be found [here](https://www.mpp.org/states/connecticut/gov-lamonts-adult-use-cannabis-regulation-bill/).\n\nAbout 65% of Connecticut residents support the legalization of marijuana.\n\n\n\n","data":{"states":["Connecticut","Illinois","Minnesota","New Hampshire","New Jersey","New Mexico","New York","Vermont"],"customMeta":{"relatedArticles":["next-states-to-legalize-weed",{"link":"recreational-weed-states","title":"Recreational Weed States - States That Have Legalized Weed"},"marijuana-laws-by-state","states-with-medical-marijuana","opioid-epidemic-by-state",{"link":"cbd-legal-states","title":"CBD Legal States"},"mushroom-laws-by-state","mental-health-statistics-by-state"]}},"sources":[{"name":"After Illinois, these states could legalize recreational marijuana next","link":"https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/06/14/next-states-likely-legalize-marijuana/1426972001/"}],"lastModified":"2020-04-06T20:09:05.168Z","path":"next-states-to-legalize-weed","name":"Next States To Legalize Weed"},{"article":"The National Football League consists of 32 teams, divided between the National Football Conference (NFC) and the American Football Conference (AFC).

The Boston Bruins joined as the first American team in 1924. From 1942-1967, there were six teams total in the NHL, called the âOriginal Six.â These teams are the Montreal Canadiens, Toronto Maple Leafs, Boston Bruins, Detroit Red Wings, Chicago Blackhawks, and New York Rangers.\r\n\r\nToday, the NHL is comprised of 31 teams, 24 in the United States and 7 in Canada.

Unfortunately, this isnât always the case, which is why some people opt to get a divorce. There are a number of reasons that couples get divorced, whether itâs because of adultery, abuse, or something less sinister. \n\nBecause marriage is legally recognized, the couple must go through legal means in order to get a divorce. This means that paperwork must be filed with the local court, attorneys need to be hired, and mediation may occur in order to discuss splitting property, child support, and child visitation. \n\nIn some cases, the parties involved in the divorce donât want to cast blame on the other partner. If both partners agree to this, they can file what is known as a no-fault divorce. In other words, the divorcing couple can tell the court that the marriage is over without having to provide a reason. California was the first state to implement no-fault divorce laws in 1970. \n\nIn 2019, all 50 states have allow no-fault grounds for divorce. However, there are just 17 states that are known as âtrueâ no-fault states. This means that there is no option to cast blame and couples can only file on no-fault grounds. These states are as follows: \n\n- California\n- Colorado\n- Florida\n- Hawaii\n- Indiana\n- Iowa\n- Kansas\n- Kentucky\n- Michigan\n- Minnesota\n- Missouri\n- Montana\n- Nebraska\n- Nevada\n- Oregon\n- Washington\n- Wisconsin\n- Washington, D.C. also has true no-fault divorce laws. \n\nThis doesnât necessarily mean that a divorce canât be filed on other grounds. In some states, divorce can be filed on other grounds in unusual circumstances, such as insanity of one of the partners. In these states, the unusual circumstance must be proven. \n\nIn the remaining states, a divorce can occur on no-fault grounds. However, these states also allow couples to cast blame through traditional fault grounds. Some states also require the couple to live apart for a certain length of time before officially filing for divorce. For example, Kentuckyâs requirements are two months, while Hawaii requires couples to be separated for at least 2 years. \n\n","sources":[{"name":"No Fault Divorce Vs.

When you have car insurance, you pay an insurance provider a premium to protect yourself from financial loss if youâre involved in a car accident.\n\nThere are two main types of auto insurance. The first is known as tort car insurance. Under this insurance, the fault is assigned to one party involved in the accident. For example, if a person fails to stop for a red light and causes an accident, the person running the light would be deemed responsible for the accident. The at-fault party would be responsible for covering medical bills and property damage. A person without insurance would be personally accountable for these costs. If they did not pay, the other party could sue. If the person has automobile insurance, all or most of these costs will be covered depending on the at-fault partyâs coverage limits.\n\nThe other type of car insurance laws are known as âno fault.â This means that all drivers cover their expenses as a result of an accident, regardless of who was at fault. Letâs say Vehicles A and B are in a car accident. Vehicle A would file with their insurance to cover their expenses as a result of the accident. Vehicle B would file with their insurance to cover their costs.\n\nThere are a few states that have no-fault car insurance laws in place. As of 2019, those states are:\n\n- Florida\n- Hawaii\n- Kansas\n- Kentucky\n- Massachusetts\n- Michigan\n- Minnesota\n- New Jersey\n- New York\n- North Dakota\n- Pennsylvania\n- Utah\n\nUnder no-fault laws, drivers are guaranteed to receive payment regardless of who caused the accident. However, many states also have laws in place that prevent drivers from suing the other party involved in the accident. Laws vary by state.\n\nSome of the states on this list, including New Jersey and Pennsylvania, offer drivers their choice of tort or no-fault coverage. It all may seem confusing, but drivers should always have an understanding of the laws in their states by doing online research or speaking with an experienced insurance agent.\n","data":{"states":["Florida","Hawaii","Kansas","Kentucky","Massachusetts","Michigan","Minnesota","New Jersey","New York","North Dakota","Pennsylvania","Utah"],"customMeta":{"relatedArticles":["drivers-license-cost-by-state","driving-age-by-state","worst-drivers-by-state","car-dealer-fees-by-state","car-registration-fees-by-state","car-sales-tax-by-state","most-popular-car-by-state","truck-axle-weight-limits-by-state","speed-limits-by-state","no-fault-states"]}},"sources":[{"name":"Background on: No-fault auto insurance","link":"https://www.iii.org/article/background-on-no-fault-auto-insurance"}],"lastModified":"2020-04-06T20:09:05.168Z","path":"no-fault-states","name":"No Fault States"},{"article":"The Northeastern States â or the Northeast â is a region of the United States that is located south of Canada, west of the Atlantic Ocean, east of the Midwest, and north of the southern United States.\n\nThere are a total of nine states that make up the Northeast based on the definition of the region by the U.S. Census Bureau.

New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania are the Mid-Atlantic states, while the U.S. Census Bureau classifies the remaining six as New England.  \n\nTogether, these states makeup over 181 square miles and have a combined estimated population of 55,943,073. There are approximately 345.5 people per square mile in the Northeast, making this the most densely populated region in the U.S. The Northeast region is one of the most urban areas in the United States. It also leads the nation as the most economically developed and culturally diverse region.\n\nBased on 2017 Census Bureau estimates, the state of New York is the most populous in the Northeast with a population of over 19.8 million people. Pennsylvania is second-most populous with a population of over 12.8 million. These are the only two states as of November 2018 to have a population of over 10 million people.

Vermont and New Hampshire also top the list of the largest states in the Northeast by area. The smallest state by area is Rhode Island, which is just over 1,033 square miles.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, these states are further divided into two subregions. The Mid-Atlantic states are made up of New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania. The remaining six states are classified as New England. \n \nOther definitions of this region include the states of Delaware, Maryland, Washington D.C., West Virginia, and Virginia. \n \nThe nine states as defined by the U.S. Census Bureau occupy a total area of 181, 324 square miles.

Voter registration may be automatic or may require each eligible person to submit an application. Registration varies between jurisdictions. \r\n\r\nAlmost 92 million eligible Americans did not vote in the 2016 presidential election. Voter registration and participation are crucial for the nationâs democracy to function properly and for the US government to provide fair representation. \r\n\r\nLow voter registration numbers and low voter turnout can be the result of several factors. In order to increase voter registration and participation, barriers to registering to vote and barriers to voting must be eliminated, such as additional restrictions on identification forms, and reforms to ensure all eligible ballots will be securely counted. Additionally, those who have alienated from the democratic process or discouraged from voting must feel that their voice is heard by their leaders and encouraged to participate in elections.\r\n\r\nSome pro-voter policies that have shown to increase voter registration and participation are automatic voter registration, same-day voter registration, preregistration, online registration, early voting, no-excuse absentee voting, and restoring rights for formerly incarcerated people.\r\n\r\nWhile California has the highest number of registered voters at 15,690,000, the state has the second-lowest percentage of registered voters when compared to its total population.

Additionally, the House has several exclusive powers such as impeaching federal officers and electing one of the top three recipients for president if no candidate receives a majority of electors. \r\n\r\nMembers of the House of Representatives serve two-year terms and are considered for reelection every even calendar year (the next reelections will be 2020, 2022, 2024, and so on).

Obesity is a growing concern in the United States and around the world.  \r\n\r\nThe United States ranks 12th in the world for obesity. According to the Center for Disease Control (CDC), approximately 36.9% of American adults age 20 and older were obese based on 2015-2016 data. 37.9% of men and 41.1% of women are considered to be obese in the United States. This is twice as many as three decades ago. Approximately 15% of children and teens are overweight; three times as many as there were in the 1980s.\r\n\r\nObesity is the result of several factors such as overeating, lack of physical activity, poor diet choices, genetics, metabolism, and culture. Americans are more likely to consume simple carbohydrates, convenient fast food and processed pre-packaged foods. These foods tend to be higher in calories, less filling, and less nutrient-dense, causing people to consume more calories than they need. This caloric surplus combined with a lack of physical activity and exercise causes weight gain over time.\r\n\r\nObesity can lead to increased health risks such as type 2 diabetes, nerve damage, kidney disease, high blood pressure, stroke, heart disease and certain types of cancer. Obesity is the second leading cause of preventable death behind tobacco use. \r\n\r\nAccording to [The State of Obesity](https://www.stateofobesity.org/adult-obesity/), the most recent Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data shows that nine states now have obesity rates above 35%. Between 2017 and 2018, Florida, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, New Mexico, New York, and Utah all saw increases in their obesity rates. Other statesâ rates remained about the same.\r\n\r\nThe ten states with the lowest obesity rates are:\r\n\r\n1.\tColorado (23%)\r\n2.\tDistrict of Columbia (24.7%)\r\n3.\tHawaii (24.9%)\r\n4.\tNew Jersey (25.7%)\r\n5.\tMassachusetts (25.7%)\r\n6.\tCalifornia (25.8%)\r\n7.\tMontana (26.9%)\r\n8.\tConnecticut (27.4%)\r\n9.\tVermont (27.5%)\r\n10.\tNew York (27.6%)\r\n\r\nColoradoâs low obesity rate can be attributed to its culture and lifestyle. Many residents enjoy outdoor activities, such as hiking, and are generally conscious of eating whole, nutrient-dense foods, and their own wellbeing. \r\n\r\nThe ten states with highest obesity rates are:\r\n\r\n1.\tWest Virginia (39.5%)\r\n2.\tMississippi (39.5%)\r\n3.\tArkansas (37.1%)\r\n4.\tLouisiana (36.8%)\r\n5.\tKentucky (36.6%)\r\n6.\tAlabama (36.2%)\r\n7.\tIowa (35.3%)\r\n8.\tNorth Dakota (35.1%) \r\n9.\tMissouri (35.0%)\r\n10.\tOklahoma (34.8%)\r\n\r\nWest Virginia and Mississippi are currently tied as the most obese state at 39.5%.

Crude oil is a mineral oil consisting of a mixture of hydrocarbons of natural origin, yellow to black in color, and of variable density and viscosity. Once extracted, crude oil undergoes distillation to break down the liquid into various products depending on weight.\r\n\r\nAs of 2018, the United States is the worldâs largest crude oil producer. The US currently produces approximately 12,108,000 barrels per day. Russia and Saudi Arabia follow the United States in crude oil production, producing 10,709,000 and 9,580,000 barrels per day respectively.\r\n\r\nThere are thousands of products derived from crude oil, all of which are very beneficial to humans and have improved their quality of life around the world. The largest share of crude oil is used for gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, and heating oil. Other products include heavier ones used to make asphalt or lubricating oils for petroleum jelly and detergents. \r\n\r\nBased on their total crude oil production in numbers of barrels, in 2018, the top ten crude oil-producing states in the US are:\r\n\r\n1.\tTexas (1,609,075)\r\n2.\tNorth Dakota (461,531)\r\n3.\tNew Mexico (248,958)\r\n4.\tOklahoma (200,685)\r\n5.\tColorado (177,817)\r\n6.\tAlaska (174,800)\r\n7.\tCalifornia (169,166)\r\n8.\tWyoming (87,955)\r\n9.\tLouisiana (48,841)\r\n10.\tUtah (37,063)\r\n\r\nTexas is the largest producer of crude oil in the United States. In 2018, Texas produced 1,609,075 barrels of oil, which is more than the other nine states combined. Texas is pushing to become the worldâs third-largest oil producer, soon passing Iraq and Iran.\r\n\r\nThe United Statesâ smallest oil producer is Virginia, which produced about five barrels of oil in 2018. \r\n\r\nOil production in the United States, especially in Texas, is expected to continue to rise, causing crude oil imports to fall.

However, how it is carried is dictated by the laws of the state. In some states, concealed carry is legal, which means that the gun can be carried on a licensed person but must not be visible to other people.\n\nOn the other hand, some states have what is known as open carry, which means that a person can carry their firearm legally in a holster or attached to a sling so that it is easily accessible. It does not need to be concealed from other people.\n\nIn recent years, more states are making open carry legal. The argument in favor of open carry is that criminals usually hide their weapons, while law-abiding citizens should not be forced to conceal their weapons.\n\nOn the other side, gun control groups have voiced their opposition to the practice of open carry. Even so, many states allow open carry, at least in some situations. When discussing open carry, there are several different categories of the law.\n\nThe first is permissive open carry. This means that it is legal to carry a firearm on foot and in a vehicle openly. A license or permit is not required to open carry in these states.\n\nThere are also states with permissive open carry with local restrictions. These states generally allow open carry without a license, but there may be restrictions on locations or modes of carrying for non-license holders. States with these laws include:\n\n- Colorado\n- Iowa\n- Missouri\n- Nebraska\n- Oregon\n- Pennsylvania\n\nOther states are licensed open carry states. This means that a permit is required to carry a handgun openly. States with these laws include:\n\n- American Samoa\n- Connecticut\n- Georgia\n- Guam\n- Hawaii\n- Indiana\n- Maryland\n- Massachusetts\n- Minnesota\n- New Jersey\n- North Dakota\n- Oklahoma\n- Rhode Island\n- Tennessee\n- Texas\n- Utah\n\nThere are also anomalous open carry states. This means that open carry is against the law for the most part, except unincorporated areas with population densities that fall below a certain threshold. The only state with these laws is the state of California.\n\n#### Open Carry vs. Concealed Carry\nOpen carry and concealed carry both allow licensed gun owners to carry a firearm with them. Open carry allows gun owners to carry their firearm visible to other people, such as strapped to their belts. Concealed carry requires gun owners to conceal or hide their weapon well enough so that no one can see it, such as completely tucked into an article of clothing or kept in a backpack or purse. Whether the gun owner needs a permit to open carry or conceal carry depends on the state.\n\nBoth types of carry have their pros and cons. Open carry allows oneâs weapon to be easily accessible and can serve as a deterrent for criminals. Open carry, however, is subject to negative public perception and might make a person open carrying the first target of a criminal. Concealed carry is legal, with or without a permit (depending on your jurisdiction), in all 50 states and can help the gun owner avoid harassment from law enforcement or unwanted conversation about oneâs decision to carry. On the other hand, concealed carry can lead to a slower draw time if the firearm is needed and will not deter potential criminals because it is not visible. Additionally, one might need to adjust his/her everyday attire in order to conceal the weapon.

Opioids are a class of drug that not only include the illegal drug heroin, but also legal drugs prescribed by doctors for pain. These drugs can help relieve severe pain but unfortunately are highly addictive, while withdrawals from not having the drug are painful. People that no longer have access to the legal drugs they are prescribed may purchase opioids illegally. Not only does this affect a personâs personal life and increase the chances for criminal charges, but abuse of opioids can lead to overdose â¦ and even death. \n \nThe National Institution on Drug Abuse has released data for the opioid prescription rates and opioid overdose death rates from 2017. Based on this information, the state of Tennessee had the highest opioid prescription rate of 94.4 for every 100 persons. Oklahomaâs prescription rate was the second-highest in the nation at 88.1 per every 100 persons. Kentucky also had a high prescription rate at 86.8. \n \nThe opioid prescription rate by state ranked from highest to lowest is as follows: \n \n- Tennessee: 94.4\n- Oklahoma: 88.1\n- Kentucky: 86.8\n- West Virginia: 81.3\n- South Carolina: 79.3\n- Michigan: 74.0\n- Nevada: 73.0\n- North Carolina: 72.0\n- Missouri: 71.8\n- Georgia: 70.9\n- Oregon: 66.1\n- Utah: 63.8\n- Ohio: 63.5\n- Arizona: 61.2\n- Washington: 57.2\n- Iowa: 56.4\n- New Mexico: 56.4\n- Maine: 55.7\n- Texas: 53.1\n- Colorado: 52.9\n- Virginia: 52.9\n- New Hampshire: 52.8\n- Wisconsin: 52.6\n- Alaska: 52.0\n- Maryland: 51.7\n- Rhode Island: 51.2\n- Illinois: 51.1\n- Vermont: 50.5\n- Connecticut: 48.0\n- Minnesota: 41.0\n- Massachusetts: 40.1\n- California: 39.5\n- New York: 37.8\n- Hawaii: 37.0\n- Washington, D.C.: 28.5\n \nThe remaining 16 states did not meet inclusion criteria of this study. \n \nWhen it comes to overdoses caused by opioids, the highest rates of death were in West Virginia, where 49.6 out of every 100,000 persons died from an opioid-involved overdose death.

For US workers at companies with fewer than 50 employees, there is no legal right to maternity leave - whether paid or unpaid. This idea results in only 12 percent of Americans receiving paid parental leave, with this number being even worse among low-income families and families of color, where the amount can be as low as 5 percent. \r\n \r\nOnly eight states have publicly funded paid maternity leave: California, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, New York, Washington, Connecticut, and Oregon. \r\n \r\nCaliforniaâs new law for paid parental leave, the New Parent Leave Act, took effect in 2019. This rule allows for new parents who work for a company with at least 20 employees to take leave for up to 12 weeks. \r\n \r\nMassachusetts also granted paid family leave in 2019 with the Massachusetts Paid Family and Medical Leave Act (MA PFML). Like in California, the MA PMFL provides up to 12 weeks of paid leave for employees who work at companies where the employer pays into the unemployment insurance fund. This means that if you work in another state but commute to Massachusetts, you will be able to receive this paid family leave.\r\n \r\nIn New Jersey, new parents can take up to six weeks of partially paid parental leave, thanks to the New Jersey Family Leave Act. \r\n \r\nRhode Islandâs Parental and Family Medical Leave Act guarantees employees up to 13 weeks of leave for a serious health condition, including pregnancy, in two calendar years. \r\n\r\nPaid family leave became mandatory in New York on January 1, 2018. This leave is being introduced on a phased approach - employees are now guaranteed up to 8 weeks of paid family leave, and this number will go up to 12 weeks by 2021.\r\n\r\nBeginning in January 2020, employees in Washington start being able to apply for paid family and medical leave benefits. These benefits will allow for up to 12 weeks of paid leave per year.\r\n\r\nIn 2022, employees in Connecticut will be able to request and take paid family leave through the Connecticut Family and Medical Leave Act (CTFMLA). \r\nThe most recent state to require paid maternity leave is Oregon. The bill was signed into law in August 2019 and is the first of its kind. Unlike other states, Oregon will provide 100 percent wage replacement for all employees (even those who may be in the country illegally) as long earn at least $1000 in a calendar year. \r\n\r\nWhile there has been a considerable shift in recent years, 42 states still do not provide any form of protection to those who work for a company with no paid family leave. \r\n","sources":[{"name":"Paid Family Leave in the States","link":"http://www.ncsl.org/research/labor-and-employment/paid-family-leave-in-the-states.aspx"}],"lastModified":"2020-04-06T20:09:05.168Z","path":"paid-maternity-leave-by-state","name":"Paid Maternity Leave By State"},{"article":"In a world where people can do whatever they please, it would click that it would be a safer place to live.

But before anyone goes out there and purchases one for themselves, it's essential to understand the laws surrounding its possession in each state. \n\n## Is It Legal To Carry? \nIn all 50 states and Washington D.C., it is legal to use pepper spray for self-defense purposes. However, some states only allow the use and carry of pepper spray under certain circumstances. \n\nFor instance, some states have certain circumstances where people can only carry pepper spray based on its/their:\n\n- Size\n- Concentration\n- Age (at least 18 years-old)\n- Restrictions (felons are not allowed to purchase pepper spray)\n\nCurrently, 13 states have specific conditions for their pepper spray law. Washington D.C. is also included within this list.\n\n## Where Can Pepper Spray Be Carried?\nTypically, it is legal to carry pepper spray in public. However, there are certain cases where pepper spray has to either remain concealed or cannot be taken in various buildings and establishments. \n\nOne place that pepper spray is not allowed is commercial airlines. It could pose a significant risk if it ends up accidentally getting sprayed. Carrying pepper spray on these airlines is a felony that can have a fine up to $25,000.\n\nAnother place where pepper spray is not allowed is specially secured buildings, like governmental buildings and state establishments. This action became illegal after the events of 9/11 occurred in 2001.\n\nAs of right now, all 50 states and Washington D.C. enforce these laws with no excuses. Anyone who is caught with pepper spray in a forbidden area will face penalties and fines.\n\n## Who Can Carry Pepper Spray?\nThroughout the country, it is implied that only people who are 18 or older can purchase and carry pepper spray. Also, there are specific regulations that prevent certain people from accessing this self-defense tool.\n\nThere are two types of people who cannot have access to pepper spray for any reason:\n\n- Children\n- Felons\n\nChildren should not possess pepper spray under any circumstances. They could spray it recklessly and possibly end up hurting others and themselves if they're not careful.\n\nFelons also shouldn't possess or use any pepper spray.

The game is not available in 6 states:\r\n \r\nLaunched in 1992, Powerball was the first of its kind because the game is played by using two machines, as opposed to other lottery games that only use one device. To play Powerball, hopeful players pay either $2 or $3 to select five numbers from a set of 69 white balls and 26 red âPowerballs.â\r\n \r\nDrawings are held every Wednesday and Saturday at 10:59 p.m. EST. The winning numbers are selected from the two identical machines, one containing the white balls, with the other providing the red balls.\r\n \r\nPayouts for Powerball are higher than the average lottery, ranging from $40 million to $1.586 billion, the record for the largest lottery jackpot in history, set on January 13, 2016. This payout was split by three fortunate winners in California, Tennessee, and Florida. These winners beat the odds â the average odds of winning Powerball are 1 in over 292 billion.\r\n \r\nWinners have the option to receive their payout in two ways: they can either receive 30 payments over 29 years, or a lump sum, which provides the winner with the instant gratification of winning, but they end up taking home less money at the end of the day as this amount is subject to the state tax.\r\n \r\nAs stated earlier, the game is not available in six states. Read on to find out why. \r\n \r\n1. Nevada does not have any lotteries, as it is a strictly gaming state.\r\n2. Alabama formally does not participate in any lotteries as it is in the Bible Belt. However, recent efforts have been made to allow residents to vote for a lottery, as many go to border states to play. \r\n3. Mississippi has seen an increase in casino-style gaming in cities like Gulfport and Biloxi. \r\n4. Utah was founded in Mormonism, and its state constitution bans all forms of gambling, but many residents buy tickets along the border with Wyoming and Idaho. \r\n5. Alaska is sparsely populated, so there is a concern that a lottery would not pay off. However, smaller gaming options, like bingo and dog mushersâ contests, are readily available.\r\n6. Hawaii has the same problem as Alaska. Lawmakers have often proposed a lottery, but the idea always fails. There is no state lottery allowed on the island. \r\n \r\nHowever, even states where Powerball is played can be unlucky. Not all states have ever had a winner, including Maine, North Dakota, Vermont, and Wyoming. \r\n \r\nWith over 10 percent (or 39) of all Powerball winners, Indiana has been home to the most winners. Missouri has the second-highest number of winners (31), with over 8 percent. \r\n \r\nHereâs a breakdown of the more-lucky states:\r\n1. Indiana: 39\r\n2. Missouri: 31\r\n3. Minnesota: 22\r\n4. Kentucky: 18\r\n5. Pennsylvania: 18\r\n6. Louisiana: 17\r\n7. Wisconsin: 17\r\n8. Arizona: 13\r\n9. Florida: 12\r\n10. Kansas: 11\r\n11. New Hampshire: 11\r\n12. Washington, D.C.: 11\r\n13.

It is also played in Washington, D.C., the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico. Powerball was first played beginning in 1992 across 23 states and has paid out millions of dollars to lucky winners ever since. \n\nTo win, biweekly drawings are held every Wednesday and Saturday night. Five winning numbers plus the Powerball number are drawn. There are multiple prizes that can be won by matching the numbers on a purchased ticket with the drawn numbers. For example, just matching the red Powerball results in a $4 win. Matching all five numbers plus the Powerball results in a win of the grand prize. \n\nThe Powerball jackpot starts at $40 million. If there are no grand prize winners at the time of the drawing, the jackpot continues to grow. This game holds the record for the largest jackpot ever awarded at $1.58 billion.\n\nWinners can choose to receive their money in two ways. The first is through 30 graduated payments over 29 years. If the winner prefers to receive a lump sum, that is also an option, but the winner takes home a smaller amount.  \n\nNot all states that play the Powerball have had a jackpot winner. In fact, a total of four states plus the U.S. Virgin Islands have not yet had a grand prize winner as of August 2019. The states that have not yet had a winner are Maine, North Dakota, Vermont, and Wyoming. \n\nOn the flip side, there are some states that have had multiple jackpot winners. Indiana has been home to the most Powerball winners. With 39 winners, this represents over 10% of all jackpot winners. Missouri has the second highest number of winners at 31 â or over 8% of the total winners. \n\nMinnesota is home to nearly 6% of all jackpot winners with a total of 22. Kentucky and Pennsylvania are tied with the next highest numbers â 18 each.

However, this ownership comes at a price. Not only will you have an auto loan or mortgage, insurance, and repair costs, but you also have to pay property taxes. \n\nProperty taxes are paid to your state and contribute to the stateâs revenue. This revenue is used for a variety of purposes, including building schools, repairing roads, and building other critical infrastructure. Property taxes are paid on an annual basis and the amount you pay varies by state. \n\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the average household pays over $2,200 per year for their homes. Across the 27 states with property taxes on vehicles, the average paid is about $440 annually. \n\nFor this article, we are going to look at the median property tax rate of each state. This is calculated by dividing the median tax payment of each state by the median home price. Based on this data, the state with the highest median tax rate is New Jersey. As of 2019, the median tax rate in this state is 1.89%. \n\nNew Hampshire falls just a little behind with a media property tax rate of 1.86%. Coming in third place is Texas with a rate of 1.81%. \n\nMany of the states in the U.S. have a median property tax rate of at least 1%. These states are: Wisconsin, Nebraska, Illinois, Connecticut, Michigan, Vermont, North Dakota, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Iowa, Kansas, South Dakota, New York, Maine, Minnesota, Massachusetts, and Alaska. \n\nNow, letâs take a look at the states with the lowest median property tax rates.

A good education is important to these families, who may even choose where they purchase or rent housing in order to make sure their children are in the best school systems. \n\nWhile there is no comprehensive way to measure what public schools are the best in the nation, there are a few surveys that look at data including high school graduation rates and college readiness to determine which states have the best schools. \n\n[WalletHub](https://wallethub.com/edu/e/states-with-the-best-schools/5335/#methodology) ranked each stateâs public schools for âQualityâ and âSafetyâ using 29 relevant metrics.

Radon has no immediate symptoms that will alert someone of its presence and it takes years of exposure before any problems become apparent.\r\n\r\nAccording to the US EPA, nearly 1in 3 homes checked in seven states had radon levels over the [recommended action level](https://sosradon.org/Radon%20Basics#what-is-a-picocurie) for radon exposure of 4 pCi/L. The pCi in âpCi/Lâ is a picocurie, which is one-trillionth of a curie and is the measure of the rate of radioactive decay of radon. At 4 pCi/L, there will be approximately 12,672 disintegrations in one liter of air during a 24-hour period.\r\n\r\nAccording to [Air Chek, Inc.](https://www.radon.com/maps/), 31 states have radon exposure above 4 pCi/L. In general, these states are in the northern half of the United States. Only five states and the District of Columbia are considered to have low radon levels. Those states are:\r\n\r\n-\tArizona\r\n-\tFlorida\r\n-\tDistrict of Columbia\r\n-\tMississippi\r\n-\tLouisiana\r\n-\tHawaii\r\n\r\nHawaii has the lowest radon levels of all 50 states with an average level of 0 pCi/L. The uranium content of Hawaiian rocks is low and most rocks near the surface are porous, allowing for air infiltration to dilute radon. \r\n\r\nThe ten states with the highest levels of radon are:\r\n\r\n1.\tAlaska\r\n2.\tSouth Dakota\r\n3.\tPennsylvania\r\n4.\tOhio\r\n5.\tWashington\r\n6.\tMontana \r\n7.\tKentucky\r\n8.\tIdaho\r\n9.\tColorado\r\n10.\tWest Virginia\r\n\r\nAlaska has the highest radon levels of 10.7 pCi/L.

About 21.3% of women surveyed reported completed or attempted rape at some point in their lives, with 1.2% reporting completed or attempted rape in the 12 months preceding the survey. About 2.6% of men reported experiencing completed or attempted rape at some point in their lives. About 81.3% of female victims and 70.8% of male victims experienced their first completed or attempted rape before the age of 25.\n\nIt is important to note that rape is widely unreported, and therefore statistics on rape are not always accurate depictions of the actual number of incidents. However, the #MeToo movement has helped the number of \n\nRape statistics vary from state to state and can be influenced by factors such as demographics, culture, economics, and law enforcement capabilities. \n\n## States with the Highest Rape Statistics\n\n#### 1. Alaska\nAlaska has the highest rape rate in the United State of 161.6 rapes per 100,000 inhabitants. Alaska tends to have higher crime rates than other states, in large part due to the lack of law enforcement, especially in rural, isolated communities. The state in particular is dangerous for women, with 59% of Alaskan women experiencing intimate partner violence, sexual violence, or both. \n\n#### 2. Michigan\nMichigan has the second-highest rape rate of 76.9 rapes per 100,000 inhabitants. Rape is especially prevalent in Detroit, where a crime report from 2018 showed reductions in every type of crime in the city, except for rape. In 2018, the number of reported rapes in Detroit was 894, a 28% increase from 697 in 2017. University of Michigan saw a 150% increase in reported rapes between 2017 and 2018, from 18 to 45. Officials believe that the #MeToo campaign is partially responsible for the increases.\n\n#### 3. Nevada\nWith a rape rate of 76.8 per 100,000, Nevadaâs rape rate puts it just below Michiganâs as the third highest rate in the country. Las Vegas Police and the Rape Crisis Center of Southern Nevada have seen a steady increase in the number of rape cases reported since the #MeToo movement. The [Nevada Uniform Crime Report](https://rccd.nv.gov/uploadedFiles/gsdnvgov/content/About/UCR/Crime%20in%20Nevada%202017%20(FINAL).pdf) shows that the most probable demographics for offenders in Nevada are males between the ages of 30-34. \n\n#### 4. Arkansas\nArkansasâs rape rate is 72.9 rapes per 100,000 inhabitants, making it the fourth-highest in the country. Like other states, the number of rape cases reported at state universities has increased significantly.\n\n#### 5. Colorado\nColorado has the fifth-highest rape rate in the United States of 71.5 rapes per 100,000 in habitants. Coloradoâs high rape rate can be attributed to victimsâ confidence in reporting assaults and having a better shot of conviction for the offender. This includes the #MeToo movement and high-profile rape allegations sweeping news headlines and Coloradoâs laws that mandates DNA testing of the accused and that sexual assault evidence be tested within 180 days of submission. \n\n\nIn contrast, the states with the lowest rape rates are:\n\n1.\tNew Jersey (16 per 100,000)\n2.\tMississippi (18 per 100,000)\n3.\tConnecticut (23.5 per 100,000)\n4.\tGeorgia (25.2 per 100,000)\n5.\tNorth Carolina (25.4 per 100,000)\n\n","data":{"states":[],"customMeta":{"columns":["state",{"header":"Total Rapes","field":"totalRapes","format":"numberWithCommas"},{"header":"Rapes per 100k Pop.","field":"rapesPer100k","format":"floatNumber"}],"sortField":"rapesPer100k","sortAsc":false,"showAllStates":true,"tileMap":{"field":"rapesPer100k"},"relatedArticles":["poorest-states","pepper-spray-laws-by-state","opioid-epidemic-by-state","human-trafficking-statistics-by-state","gun-violence-by-state","life-expectancy-by-state"]},"customData":[{"rapesPer100k":40.8,"totalRapes":1996,"state":"Alabama"},{"rapesPer100k":161.6,"totalRapes":1192,"state":"Alaska"},{"rapesPer100k":50.7,"totalRapes":3638,"state":"Arizona"},{"rapesPer100k":72.9,"totalRapes":2196,"state":"Arkansas"},{"rapesPer100k":39.2,"totalRapes":15505,"state":"California"},{"rapesPer100k":71.5,"totalRapes":4070,"state":"Colorado"},{"rapesPer100k":23.5,"totalRapes":840,"state":"Connecticut"},{"rapesPer100k":34.9,"totalRapes":338,"state":"Delaware"},{"rapesPer100k":64.1,"totalRapes":450,"state":"District of Columbia"},{"rapesPer100k":39.6,"totalRapes":8438,"state":"Florida"},{"rapesPer100k":25.2,"totalRapes":2651,"state":"Georgia"},{"rapesPer100k":44,"totalRapes":625,"state":"Hawaii"},{"rapesPer100k":45.1,"totalRapes":791,"state":"Idaho"},{"rapesPer100k":46,"totalRapes":5859,"state":"Illinois"},{"rapesPer100k":35.4,"totalRapes":2370,"state":"Indiana"},{"rapesPer100k":30.9,"totalRapes":976,"state":"Iowa"},{"rapesPer100k":53.8,"totalRapes":1567,"state":"Kansas"},{"rapesPer100k":38.2,"totalRapes":1707,"state":"Kentucky"},{"rapesPer100k":44.7,"totalRapes":2085,"state":"Louisiana"},{"rapesPer100k":33.3,"totalRapes":446,"state":"Maine"},{"rapesPer100k":32.8,"totalRapes":1979,"state":"Maryland"},{"rapesPer100k":34.9,"totalRapes":2410,"state":"Massachusetts"},{"rapesPer100k":76.9,"totalRapes":7690,"state":"Michigan"},{"rapesPer100k":43.9,"totalRapes":2462,"state":"Minnesota"},{"rapesPer100k":18,"totalRapes":537,"state":"Mississippi"},{"rapesPer100k":47.5,"totalRapes":2912,"state":"Missouri"},{"rapesPer100k":51.9,"totalRapes":551,"state":"Montana"},{"rapesPer100k":63.9,"totalRapes":1223,"state":"Nebraska"},{"rapesPer100k":76.8,"totalRapes":2329,"state":"Nevada"},{"rapesPer100k":39.4,"totalRapes":534,"state":"New Hampshire"},{"rapesPer100k":16,"totalRapes":1424,"state":"New Jersey"},{"rapesPer100k":64.6,"totalRapes":1354,"state":"New Mexico"},{"rapesPer100k":33.6,"totalRapes":6575,"state":"New York"},{"rapesPer100k":25.4,"totalRapes":2633,"state":"North Carolina"},{"rapesPer100k":52.2,"totalRapes":397,"state":"North Dakota"},{"rapesPer100k":45.3,"totalRapes":5300,"state":"Ohio"},{"rapesPer100k":58.3,"totalRapes":2299,"state":"Oklahoma"},{"rapesPer100k":47.1,"totalRapes":1975,"state":"Oregon"},{"rapesPer100k":35,"totalRapes":4483,"state":"Pennsylvania"},{"rapesPer100k":45.5,"totalRapes":481,"state":"Rhode Island"},{"rapesPer100k":47.9,"totalRapes":2434,"state":"South Carolina"},{"rapesPer100k":69.6,"totalRapes":614,"state":"South Dakota"},{"rapesPer100k":41.7,"totalRapes":2821,"state":"Tennessee"},{"rapesPer100k":51.2,"totalRapes":14693,"state":"Texas"},{"rapesPer100k":55.5,"totalRapes":1753,"state":"Utah"},{"rapesPer100k":45.8,"totalRapes":287,"state":"Vermont"},{"rapesPer100k":34.3,"totalRapes":2924,"state":"Virginia"},{"rapesPer100k":45.3,"totalRapes":3413,"state":"Washington"},{"rapesPer100k":36.1,"totalRapes":652,"state":"West Virginia"},{"rapesPer100k":38.7,"totalRapes":2248,"state":"Wisconsin"},{"rapesPer100k":42.1,"totalRapes":243,"state":"Wyoming"}]},"sources":[{"name":"FBI Crime Statistics","link":"https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2018/crime-in-the-u.s.-2018/topic-pages/tables/table-5"}],"lastModified":"2020-04-26T01:42:05.859Z","path":"rape-statistics-by-state","name":"Rape Statistics By State"},{"article":"The [REAL ID Act](https://www.dhs.gov/real-id), passed in 2005 as per the 9/11 Commissionâs recommendation, establishes minimum standards for the issuance, security, and authentication of driverâs licenses and identification cards. The act prohibits federal agencies from accepting driverâs licenses and identification cards from states not meeting the minimum standards for purposes such as boarding federally regulated commercial flights, accessing Federal facilities, and entering nuclear power plants. \n\nOn December 20, 2013, the Department of Homeland Security announced a phased enforcement plan for the REAL ID Act to implement it in a fair and measured way.

The term is often used in conjunction with substance abuse as a synonym for ârelapseâ but is specifically used for criminal behavior.\r\n\r\nAccording to the National Institute of Justice, almost 44% of criminals released return before the end of their first year out of prison. In 2005, about 68% of 405,000 prisoners that were released were arrested for a new crime within three years, and 77% were arrested within five years. \r\n\r\nFactors contributing to recidivism include a personâs social environment and community, their circumstances before incarceration, events during their incarceration, and, one of the main reasons, difficulty adjusting back into normal life. Many of these individuals have trouble reconnecting with family and finding a job to support themselves. \r\n\r\nIncarceration rates in the U.S. began increasing dramatically in the 1990s. The U.S. is 5% of the worldâs population and 25% of the worldâs prisoners. Prisons are overcrowded and inmates are forced to live in inhumane conditions, even those who are innocent and awaiting trial. \r\n\r\nThe United States justice system places its efforts on getting criminals off of the streets by locking them up but fails to fix the issue of preventing these people from reoffending afterward. This is why many believe that the U.S. prison system is greatly flawed. \r\n\r\nRecidivism affects everyone: the offender, their family, the victim of the crime, law enforcement, and the community overall. Crime can affect anyone in any community, and if a previously-incarcerated person is released only to repeat an offense or act out a new crime, there are going to be new victims. Furthermore, taxpayers are impacted by the economic cost of crime and incarceration as the average per-inmate cost of incarceration in the U.S. is $31,286 per year. \r\n\r\n[Steps](https://www.correctionsone.com/re-entry-and-recidivism/articles/6-evidence-based-practices-proven-to-lower-recidivism-MRzqFIO9P1okPNBF/) can be taken during incarceration to decrease recidivism. First is an assessment of the risks for reoffending and the criminogenic needs that contributed to their breaking of the law, such as a lack of self-control or an antisocial peer group. Second is to assess their individual motivators, followed by choosing the appropriate treatment program. The fourth step is to implement evidence-based programming that emphasizes cognitive-behavioral strategies, coupled with positive reinforcement that can help them recognize and feel good about positive behavior. Lastly, the formerly incarcerated need ongoing support from a good peer group, as repeat offenders who were in gang culture have the greatest challenge to stay away from that behavior. \r\n\r\n#### Alabama\r\n\r\nAccording to the Alabama Department of Corrections, the recidivism rate for Alabama prisons is 31% for men and 21% for women. Alabama defines recidivism as returning to custody within three years of release.\r\n\r\n#### Alaska\r\n\r\nAccording to the Alaska Department of Corrections, the recidivism rate in Alaska is 66.41, with two-thirds of those individuals being reincarcerated within six months of being released. This is the highest rate in the country. Alaska defines recidivism as returning to custody within three years of release.\r\n\r\n#### Arizona\r\n\r\nAccording to Charles Ryan, the director of the Arizona Department of Corrections, the recidivism rate in Arizona is around 40%. Arizona defines recidivism as returning to custody within three years of release.\r\n\r\n#### Arkansas\r\n\r\nAccording to an Arkansas Department of Corrections [report](https://adc.arkansas.gov/images/uploads/2013_Recidivism_Study_Final_May_2018.pdf) on findings from 2013, the recidivism rate in Arkansas is 58.21% over three years for those released on parole and 24.39% for those who discharged their sentence. Males had a higher recidivism rate of 57.65% and females had a rate of 48.21%. \r\n\r\n#### California\r\n\r\nAccording to the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, the recidivism rate in California has averaged around 50% over the past ten years. \r\n\r\n#### Colorado\r\n\r\nAccording to the Colorado District Attorneysâ Council, the recidivism rate in Colorado is 50%. \r\n\r\n#### Connecticut\r\n\r\nAccording to the State of Connecticut Office of Policy and Management Criminal Justice Policy and Planning Division, the recidivism rate in Connecticut is 34%. \r\n\r\n#### Delaware\r\n\r\nDelawareâs three-year recidivism rate is 64.9% percent, the second-highest rate in the country behind Alaska. \r\n\r\n#### Florida\r\n\r\nAccording to a study released by the Florida Department of Corrections, Floridaâs recidivism rate is about 25% over three years. This is well below the national average and is one of the lowest among all states.\r\n\r\n#### Georgia\r\n\r\nThe state of Georgia reports a 30% recidivism rate; however, the actual recidivism rate is closer to 50% when taking into account the number of people who commit a technical violation while on probation or parole and the number of people who recidivate after the three-year period. \r\n\r\n#### Hawaii\r\n\r\nA [report](https://icis.hawaii.gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Hawaii-Revidivism-2017.pdf) from the Interagency Council on Intermediate Sanctions states that the recidivism rate in Hawaii is about 48.9%.  \r\n\r\n#### Idaho\r\n\r\nThe recidivism rate in Idaho is about 35% and the rate for offenders who were imprisoned for parole violations average about 3% higher. Idaho has one of the lowest crime rates in the country but one of the highest incarceration rates. A large portion of those who are incarcerated are repeat offenders.\r\n\r\n#### Illinois\r\n\r\nThe recidivism rate in Illinois within one year of release is 17% and within three years of release is 43%. The Illinois Sentencing Policy Advisory Council estimated that the recidivism rate will cost taxpayers $13 billion over five years if nothing is done to decrease it. \r\n\r\n#### Indiana\r\n\r\nAccording to the Indiana Department of Correction, the recidivism rate in Indiana is 33.78% for both people facing a new conviction or violating parole. This is the lowest rate in Indiana in six years. \r\n\r\n#### Iowa\r\n\r\nThe recidivism rate in Iowa is 38.8%. The recidivism rate is a major contributing factor to Iowaâs highest prison population count in eight years. \r\n\r\n#### Kansas\r\n\r\nThe Corrections Secretary of Kansas reports that the three-year recidivism rate in Kansas is 33.1%. \r\n\r\n#### Kentucky\r\n\r\nKentuckyâs recidivism rate is 32.2%. The recidivism rate for those on parole or probation is 52%. \r\n\r\n#### Louisiana\r\n\r\nAccording to the Louisiana Commission on Law Enforcement, the three-year recidivism rate in Louisiana is 34.1%.

For many years, marijuana has been illegal â both for medicinal and recreational use. However, in recent years, more states are legalizing marijuana, even for recreational use.\n\nUnder federal law, marijuana is still illegal. However, states have changed their laws to make the cultivation and use of marijuana legal. In some states, marijuana has been decriminalized, meaning that criminal penalties for the possession and usage of marijuana have been reduced or eliminated.\n\nThe first states to legalize the use of recreational marijuana were Colorado and Washington in 2012. Since then, a few other states have followed suit.\n\nRecreational marijuana is legal in 11 states for adults over the age of 21 and is legal for medical use in 33 states (including the recreational states). In all states, it is illegal to drive under the influence of marijuana, whether recreational or medicinal. \n\n#### Colorado\n\nColorado was the first state to legalize recreational marijuana in 2012 with the passage of [Amendment 64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Amendment_64). Colorado first legalized medical marijuana in 2000 by passing Ballot Amendment 20. In September 2013, the Colorado Department of Revenue adopted regulations for recreational marijuana establishments and Colorado Amendment 64 was implemented in 2014 with commercial sale of marijuana to the general public beginning on January 1, 2014. \n\nIn its first year, Coloradoâs legal marijuana market reached total sales of $700 million. Colorado Governor Jared Polis signed a [law](https://reason.com/2019/12/30/new-law-finally-authorizes-cannabis-cafes-in-colorado-the-first-state-to-allow-recreational-sales/) in 2019 that would allow licensed businesses to have designated marijuana use areas. Currently, marijuana use is only permitted in private residences. \n\n#### Washington\n\nWashington state was the second state to legalize recreational marijuana in 2012 when voters approved [Initiative 502](https://lcb.wa.gov/mj-education/know-the-law), which legalized the use of cannabis for adults over the age of 21 and allowed the Washington State Liquor Control Board to regulate and tax cannabis production and sales and set new limits on blood THC levels for DUI offenses. Initiative 502 made possession of up to one ounce of marijuana by adults legal under state law on December 6, 2012; however, gifting, sale, or cultivation remained illegal. After the initiative went into effect, the Washington State Liquor control began establishing regulations for the recreational cannabis industry with a deadline of December 1, 2013. \n\nOn July 8, 2014, the first recreational marijuana stores opened to the public. Initiative 502 states that adults 21 and over can purchase up to one ounce of usable marijuana, 16 ounces of marijuana-infused edibles in solid form, 72 ounces in liquid form, and seven grams of marijuana concentrates. A 2016 survey found that the perceived harm associated with marijuana use has declined among adolescents since legalization. \n\n#### Alaska\n\nAlaska became the second state in the U.S. to decriminalize cannabis on May 6, 1975. In 1982, the Alaska legislature decriminalized possession of up to four ounces of cannabis in the home or one ounce outside the home. Medical marijuana was legalized in 1998, allowing approved patients to possess up to an ounce of cannabis or grow up to six plants. In an attempt to legalize recreational marijuana, Measure 5 in 2000 and Measure 2 in 2004 both failed to get enough votes.\n\nIn 2006, cannabis was recriminalized making possession under one ounce a misdemeanor punishable by up to 90 days in jail; possession of one to four ounces a misdemeanor punishable by up to a year in jail; and possession of over four ounces a felony. \n\nIn 2014, Measure 2 passed to legalize the recreational use of marijuana, allowing adults to possess up to an ounce of cannabis and cultivate six plants. Alaska became the third state to legalize recreational marijuana. On October 29, 2016, the first state-regulated sale of cannabis in dispensaries occurred. \n\n#### California \n\nCalifornia decriminalized cannabis in 1975 with the Moscone Act, which classifies possession of small amounts of cannabis as a civil offense instead of a criminal offense. In 1996, Proposition 215 (the Compassionate Use Act of 1996) passed, legalizing the use of medical marijuana by patients with a physicianâs approval. Senate Bill 420 established an identification card system for medical cannabis patients and allowed the formation of non-profit collectives for the provision of cannabis to patients. \n\n\nIn 2010, Proposition 19 was rejected by California voters to legalize the use, possession, and cultivation of cannabis. In 2016, [Proposition 64](https://ballotpedia.org/California_Proposition_64,_Marijuana_Legalization_(2016)) passed by a vote of 57% to 43%, legalizing recreational marijuana in both a dry and concentrated form. Legal sales of recreational marijuana began on January 1, 2018. \n\n#### Texas\n\nBefore 1973, Texas had the harshest cannabis laws of any state, classifying possession of any amount as a felony. In 1973, House Bill 447 was signed into law, reducing possession of up to two ounces to a class B misdemeanor. \n\nIn June 2015, Senate Bill 339 (the Texas Compassionate Use Act) was signed by Governor Greg Abbott to allow the use of low-THC cannabis oil for treatment of epilepsy. In June 2091, House Bill 1325 was signed by Governor Abbott to legalize the cultivation of industrial hemp (cannabis that contains less than 0.3% THC) and the possession and sale of hemp-derived CBD products. Because HB 1325 changed the definition of cannabis from all cannabis to cannabis containing greater than 0.3% THC, many marijuana possession charges in Texas were soon dropped due to a lack of THC testing equipment. House Bill 3703 was also signed in June 2019, increasing the number of qualifying conditions eligible for the stateâs medical cannabis treatment program. Recreational use is still illegal in Texas.\n\n#### New York\n\nIn 1973, New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller signed legislation that increased the penalty for selling two ounces or more or possessing four ounces or more of cannabis and other substances to a minimum of 15 years to life in prison and a maximum of 25 years to life in prison. In 1977, New York partially decriminalized marijuana possession of 25 grams or less to an infection with a $100 fine. In 2014, New York City mayor Bill De Blasio directed NYPD to stop arrests for small possession, even in cases where the 1977 law would allow arrest, and issue tickets instead.\n\nIn July 2014, Governor Andrew Cuomo signed legislation permitting the use of [medical marijuana](https://www.health.ny.gov/regulations/medical_marijuana/). In 2018, Governor Cuomo urged the New York State Legislature to fund a study on the effects of recreational marijuana use. Upon completion of this study, the Department of Health recommended the legalization of marijuana in New York, followed by an amended [Marijuana Regulation and Taxation Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marijuana_Regulation_and_Taxation_Act) bill. As of 2019, marijuana is decriminalized in New York, but it is not legal. \n\n#### Wisconsin\n\nIn April 2014, Wisconsin Act 267 was enacted to legalize the use of CBD for the treatment of seizure disorders. In February 2017, Senate Bill 10 was passed, allowing people to possess CBD oil in Wisconsin if a doctor has certified the oil as being used for medical treatment. \n\nIn 2013 and 2015, State Representative Melissa Sargent introduced bills that would fully legalize cannabis in Wisconsin, both of which were struck down. In February 2019, Governor Tony Evers announced that his upcoming budget would include a proposal to legalize medical marijuana, decriminalize possession of up to 25 grams, and establish an expungement process for convictions that involved less than 25 grams. Recreational marijuana is still illegal in Wisconsin. \n\n#### Michigan\n\nIn 2008, the Michigan Compassionate Care Initiative was passed by voters to allow patients to possess up to 2.5 ounces of cannabis for treatment of certain medical conditions with physician approval. This did not explicitly allow dispensaries to operate and in 2013, the Michigan Supreme Court ruling stated this. In September 2016, Governor Rick Snyder signed several bills that allowed the operation and regulation of medical marijuana dispensaries, set a taxation rate of 3% on medical marijuana, and allowed the use of medical marijuana in non-smokable forms such as edibles or topical products. \n\nBefore statewide legalization, several cities decriminalized cannabis or made the enforcement of cannabis laws their lowest priority. These cities include Ann Arbor, Detroit, Grand Rapids, Lansing, and Flint.\n\nIn November 2018, Michigan voters passed Proposal 1, making Michigan the 10th state to legalize recreational marijuana. The [Michigan Regulation and Taxation of Marihuana Act](https://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(rzzqvpcp54ovl4wkfuumnqwk))/documents/mcl/pdf/mcl-Initiated-Law-1-of-2018.pdf) allows adults 21 and over to possess up to 2.5 ounces of marijuana in public, up to 10 ounces at home, and to cultivate up to 12 plants at home. The act also allows for the state-licensed cultivation and distribution of marijuana, with sales subjects to a 10% excise tax and the stateâs 6% sales tax. The first dispensaries opened on December 1, 2019. \n\n\n#### Florida\n\nOn June 16, 2014, Governor Rick Scott signed into law the Compassionate Medical Cannabis Act (Senate Bill 1030), allowing the use of low-THC cannabis oil produced from the strain Charlotteâs Web for treatment of epilepsy, cancer, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. In March 2016, Governor Scott signed House Bill 307 to allow the use of cannabis for terminally ill patients, expanding Floridaâs Right to Try Act. Amendment 2 was approved on November 8, 2016, to legalize the use of cannabis with physician approval for treatment of epilepsy, cancer, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), PTSD, chronic pain caused by a qualifying medical condition, and other comparable debilitating medical conditions.\n\nUnder Florida regulations, medical marijuana could only be consumed as edibles, or by vaping, oils, sprays, or pills. Governor Ron DeSantis asked for the legislature to lift the restriction and in March 2019, a bill was signed into law that removed the prohibition on smoking medical marijuana as a treatment. Recreational marijuana is currently illegal in Florida; however, organizers are gathering support and it is likely in the stateâs future.\n\n\n#### Hawaii\n\nIn 2000, Governor Ben Cayetano signed Act 228 into law, which allowed medical marijuana cardholders to grow their own cannabis in their homes; however, it did not establish a legal market or any dispensaries. The Medical Marijuana Dispensary Program of Hawaii was created in 2015 to require those wishing to use medical marijuana to receive certification and approval from a licensed physician that the patientâs medical condition would benefit from the use of marijuana. Patients are then required to register online and receive their 329 Registration Card before starting to use medical marijuana legally.\n\nIn 2016, Senate Bill 321 established a dispensary system, allowing eight dispensaries to open in Hawaii.  The first medical marijuana dispensary sale was made in August 2017. \n\nIn February 2017, the Hawaii House of Representatives Agricultural Committee passed legislation to remove criminal or civil sanctions on industrial hemp. Beginning on January 11, 2020, Hawaii decriminalized marijuana possession of three grams or less, punishable by a $130 fine. Previously, laws were much stricter, even for small amounts of marijuana.\n\n#### Missouri\n\nIn 2014, Senate Bill 491 was enacted to reduced penalties for cannabis offenses, including possession, sale, and cultivation of cannabis. It went into effect in January 2017. \n\nIn July 2014, Governor Jay Nixon signed into law the Missouri Medical Marijuana Bill. This bill legalized the use of low-THC (no higher than 0.3% THC) CBD oil to treat epilepsy. In November 2018, Missouri voters passed Amendment 2 to legalize medical marijuana. This allowed patients with any âchronic, debilitating, or other medical conditionâ as determined by a physician to be recommended cannabis as treatment. The amendment also set a 4% tax rate on medical marijuana sales and allows qualified patients to grow up to six cannabis plants. \n\nMarijuana is decriminalized in Missouri, but recreational use is not legal.\n\n#### New Jersey\n\nIn January 2010, Governor Jon Corzine signed the Compassionate Use Medical Marijuana Act, allowing the use of medical marijuana for persons with specific conditions such as HIV/AIDS, seizure disorders, cancer, glaucoma, muscular dystrophy, Crohnâs disease, and any terminal illness, among other conditions. In 2017, additional conditions were added to the list, such as migraines, Tourette syndrome, and chronic pain.\n\nIn May 2017, state Senator Nicholas Scutari introduced legislation to legalize marijuana in New Jersey; however, it was strongly opposed by Governor Christie. After Christie left office, Scutari introduced the New Jersey Marijuana Legalization, which was passed in November 2018. The legislation also expanded access to medical marijuana and expanded the stateâs expungement process. Although the legislation passed, its progress was stagnant as lawmakers disagreed on details of legalization. During December 2018 and January 2019, negotiations took place, focusing on the tax rate and regulatory oversight of recreational marijuana; however, it collapsed in March of 2019. On December 16, 2019, a referendum was passed to be on the 2020 ballot. \n\n\n#### Arkansas\n\nThe Arkansas Medical Marijuana Act (Issue 5) was put up for vote on the state ballot in 2012, which would allow non-profit organizations to grow and sell medical marijuana and permit patients over five miles away from a legal dispensary to grow their own cannabis for medical purposes. The act was voted down.\n\nOn November 5, 2018, voters approved Issue 6 legalizing medical marijuana use as an amendment to the state constitution. Medical marijuana patients who were approved by a physician are allowed up to 2.5 ounces of cannabis for the treatment of a qualifying medical condition but were not allowed to home grow. The state initially licensed 32 dispensaries and five cultivators. Licensed sales began in May 2019. \n","frontmatter":{"title":"Recreational Weed States - States That Have Legalized Weed"},"data":{"states":[],"customMeta":{"columns":["state",{"header":"Legal

a âred stateâ and what does it mean for a Presidential Election?\n\nIf a state is a âred state,â the voters within that state primarily vote for the Republican Party. The term is also used to describe a state that is perceived to have conservative views. Blue states vote Democratic and tend to have more liberal views.\n\nThis means that red states believe in a smaller, deregulated government and have an aversion to rapid change. Red states desire to preserve the political philosophy and regulations articulated in the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution and preserve traditional morality, such as that in the Bible. \n\nDuring the 1980s, the colors were reversed and red states were democratic while blue states were republican. During the U.S. Presidential Election in 2000, journalist Tim Russert used the terms âred stateâ and âblue stateâ based on the colored maps that were used during his televised coverage of the election. Since that election, the media have used red for Republican and blue for Democrat. \n\nThe  [Cook Partisan Voting Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cook_Partisan_Voting_Index) (PVI) shown in the table below is a measurement of how strongly a United States congressional district or states leans toward the Democratic or Republican Party compared to the national average. For example, if the national average is 48% Republican, and the Republican candidate of a state win 57% of the two-party share, than that state voted nine percentage points more Republican than the country. The PVI for that state is R+9.\n\nAccording to Gallup Daily tracking numbers in 2017, a total of 13 states are solid Republican. Those states are:\n\n- Alabama\n- Alaska\n- Idaho\n- Kansas\n- Montana\n- Nebraska\n- North Dakota\n- Oklahoma\n- South Carolina\n- South Dakota\n- Tennessee\n- Utah\n- Wyoming\n\nThree additional states lean toward Republican. Those states are:\n\n- Arkansas\n- Mississippi\n- Missouri\n\nOut of these states, some are considered to be âdark redâ because they lean more republican than the other states. This includes Wyoming, the most conservative state in the United States, with a PVI of R+25. These âdark redâ states can also include Utah (R+20), Oklahoma (R+20), Idaho (R+19), and North Dakota (R+17).\n","data":{"states":["Alabama","Alaska","Idaho","Kansas","Montana","Nebraska","North

Taxes will be calculated much like how they are before retirement and it is important to estimate the amount one will pay in retirement so that finances can be planned accordingly. \r\n\r\nIf a person is relocating to a different state for retirement, it is important to examine the state taxes on retirement benefits. Some states are friendlier for retirees tax-wise than others, and because retirees have special financial concerns, taxes can be a large factor when deciding where it is best to retire.\r\n\r\nSpecial financial concerns for retirees include whether Social Security benefits are taxable at the state level, property taxes, and how retirement account and pension withdrawals are taxed. \r\n\r\nThere are seven states with no income tax: Alaska, Florida, Nevada, South Dakota, Texas, Washington, and Wyoming. New Hampshire and Tennessee impose income taxes only on dividends and interest (which Tennessee is getting rid of in 2020). These nine states are considered to be âtax-friendlyâ or âmost-tax friendlyâ for retirees among others.\r\n\r\nThe ten most tax-friendly states for retirement (in no particular order) are:\r\n\r\n1.\tAlaska\r\n2.\tFlorida\r\n3.\tGeorgia\r\n4.\tKentucky\r\n5.\tMississippi\r\n6.\tNevada\r\n7.\tNew Hampshire\r\n8.\tPennsylvania\r\n9.\tSouth Dakota\r\n10.\tWyoming\r\n\r\nSome states allow tax exemption for military personnel or emergency services personnel, or allow deductions up to a certain amount. Some states do not offer any retirement income tax benefits. These states are considered to be ânot tax-friendly,â âleast tax-friendly,â or âmixed.â\r\n\r\nThe ten least tax-friend states for retirement (in no particular order)

It all comes down to the income of the residents, as well as the revenue accrued by the local state government. By looking at the average per capita income of each state in the US, we can figure out which state is the richest of them all. Since this would be a massive undertaking to attempt on an individual level, let's leave the research to the experts. \n\nAccording to World Atlas, the richest state is Massachusetts. It is said to have an average per capita GDP rate of around $65,545. If you take the [current population](https://www.census.gov/glossary/#term_Populationestimates) of Massachusetts and multiply that value by the per capita income estimate, you would find that the state has an incredibly large GDP per capita value.\n\nSince the state of Massachusetts is currently home to about 6,902,000 people, this means that there is an influx of about $459,293,590,000 annually. This value is massive, and although Massachusetts is the richest state, many other states compare and come close to the GDP per capita value in Massachusetts. Another way of looking at richness among the nation is by taking a look at the median household income of each state. With this value in mind, the richest place in America would be the District of Columbia. Since DC is not considered a state but rather a federal district, the state with the highest average household income is none other than New Hampshire.\n\nPeople who live in New Hampshire make an average of about $71,000 per year, give or take a few hundred dollars either way. With a poverty rate of around eight percent, most people live comfortably in New Hampshire, which contributes to its wealth overall. With average household incomes, poverty rates, and unemployment percentages in mind, the top ten richest states in the USA as of 2019 are... \n\n- New Hampshire \n- Minnesota \n- Hawaii \n- North Dakota \n- Maryland \n- Utah \n- Virginia \n- Massachusetts \n- Wyoming \n- Vermont \n\n## The History of Wealth in the United States\n\nThe United States has witnessed a few recent and quite damaging dips in its economy. The Great Depression took place for just under four years, spanning from August 1929 through March 1933. Following the Great Depression, there were thirteen recessions, the most recent of which was the Great Recession. \n\nIt started in December of 2007 and was not resolved until June of 2009. Many states are still bouncing back from the drastic effects of the recession. Here is a look at the average financial situations of people in each of the fifty states over the past few years.

Even if youâve heard the term, you may not know what it means. In its simplest terms, what does it mean when a state is a right to work state?\n\nIf a state is a right to work state, this means that there are laws that allow residents to work without being forced to join a union or pay union fees. Many times, unions try to convince employers to sign contracts which would require all employees to pay union fees to be employed. In states where there are right-to-work laws, employers and labor unions are prohibited from forcing any employee that is not part of the union to pay fees. Some states also include language that prohibits employers and unions from requiring union membership as a condition for employment.\n\nIn the following states, right-to-work laws designate that payment of union dues or fees canât be a requirement for employment:\n\n- Alabama\n- Arkansas\n- Georgia\n- Idaho\n- Indiana\n- Iowa\n- Kansas\n- Kentucky\n- Louisiana\n- Michigan\n- Mississippi\n- Missouri\n- Nebraska\n- North Carolina\n- North Dakota\n- Oklahoma\n- South Carolina\n- South Dakota\n- Tennessee\n- Texas\n- Utah\n- Virginia\n- West Virginia\n- Washington\n- Wisconsin\n- Wyoming\n\nIn some states, it is outright prohibited to use the payment of union fees as a condition of employment.

This is a derogatory term used to describe areas where there is an economic decline, urban decay, high rates of poverty, and a drop in population due to deindustrialization.\n\nThese areas were struck in the 20th century for many reasons. Manufacturing is moving to overseas companies, the decline of coal and steel industries, and increased automation in industrial settings are just a few of the factors that have contributed to this deindustrialization. Cities across the nation were able to adapt to these changes by moving into other industries, like the services industry. However, other cities and towns have been severely affected. It is these areas that are part of the âRust Belt.â\n\nThese regions werenât always known as the Rust Belt, however. In their prime, these areas were identified by other nicknames such as the Factory Belt or Steel Belt.\n\nStates that are included in the Rust Belt are:\n\n- Illinois\n- Indiana\n- Michigan\n- Missouri\n- New York\n- Ohio\n- Pennsylvania\n- West Virginia\n\nSome cities in the Rust Belt region saw significant declines in their populations after deindustrialization. The biggest change was recorded in Detroit, Michigan, where the population dropped by over 29% between 2000 and 2016. Gary, Indiana, was another city that was affected, with its population dropping by over 25%. Other cities that saw significant losses in their populations include:\n\n- Flint, Michigan\n- Cleveland, Ohio\n- Dayton, Ohio\n- Buffalo, New York\n- Decatur, Illinois\n- Saint Louis, Missouri\n- Saginaw, Michigan\n","data":{"states":["Illinois","Indiana","Michigan","Missouri","New York","Ohio","Pennsylvania","West Virginia"],"customMeta":{"relatedArticles":["bible-belt-states","border-states","coastal-states",{"link":"4-corners-states","title":"Four Corners States"},"east-coast-states","eastern-states","flyover-states","gulf-states","great-lakes-states","lower-48-states",{"link":"midwest-states","title":"Midwestern United States"},{"link":"mid-atlantic-states","title":"Mid-Atlantic States"},"mountain-states","new-england-states","northern-states","rust-belt-states","southeast-states","southwest-states","west-coast-states"]}},"sources":[{"name":"Rust Belt","link":"https://www.encyclopedia.com/places/united-states-and-canada/miscellaneous-us-geography/rust-belt"}],"lastModified":"2020-04-06T20:09:05.172Z","path":"rust-belt-states","name":"Rust Belt States"},{"article":"According to the [Global Peace Index](http://visionofhumanity.org/app/uploads/2019/06/GPI-2019-web003.pdf), the United States ranks 128 out of 163 countries. The U.S. has terrorist attacks, mass shootings, hate crimes, and natural disasters making headlines often, putting citizens and visitors in danger. \n\nSafety varies from state to state. Some states are safe from some dangers but fall prey to others. In order to determine which states are the safest, WalletHub compared all 50 states across 52 safety indicators grouped into the following categories:\n\n-\tPersonal and Residential Safety\n-\tFinancial Safety\n-\tRoad Safety\n-\tWorkplace Safety\n-\tEmergency Preparedness\n\nIndicators that were used to determine the safest states include:\n\n-\tDUIs per capita\n-\tRoad quality\n-\tUnemployment rate\n-\tDebt per income\n-\tPoverty rate\n-\tNumber of mass shootings\n-\tAssaults per capita\n-\tLaw enforcement employees per capita\n-\tShare of families with children aged 0 to 17 who feel they live in safe neighborhoods\n\nEach state was given a score between 0 and 100 for each metric, with 100 being the safest. This score was used to determine which states are the safest in the U.S.\n\n#### 1. Minnesota\n\nMinnesota is the safest state in the U.S. Minnesota ranks first for Road Safety, third for Financial Safety, and seventh for Personal \u0026 Residential Safety and Workplace Safety. Minnesota has the third-highest percentage of adults with a rainy-day fund and the fourth-lowest share of uninsured people in its population. Some of the safest cities in Minnesota are Lakeville, Plymouth, Eden Prairie, and Maple Grove.\n\n#### 2. Vermont\nVermont is the second-safest state in the U.S. with a score of 64.32 â just below Minnesotaâs 64.43. Vermont ranks fourth for Financial Safety and fifth for Personal \u0026 Residential Safety. Furthermore, Vermont has one of the lowest unemployment rates in the country, has the third-lowest share of uninsured people, and has the second-fewest assaults per capita. \n\n#### 3. Maine\n\nMaine ranks third for the safest states with a score of 62.53. Maine ranks second for Personal \u0026 Residential Safety and Emergency Preparedness. Maine has the lowest number of assaults per capita of any state in the U.S. Maine has the lowest violent crime rate overall than any other state, and has the fourth-lowest property crime rate as well.\n\n#### 4. Utah\n\nUtah ranks fourth just below Maine with a score of 62.48. Utah ranks second for Workplace Safety, sixth for Emergency Preparedness, and seventh for Road Safety. Utah has the fourth-lowest total loss from climate disasters per capita and the lowest percentage of drunk driving fatalities in the U.S. Law enforcement credits the community for looking out for each other and being involved in keeping the community safe. \n\n#### 5. Connecticut\n\nAs the fifth-safest state in the U.S., Connecticut has a score of 61.49. Connecticut ranks first for Personal \u0026 Residential Safety and has the second-fewest fatal occupational injuries per total workers. Connecticut has its share of dangerous places; however, some of its safest cities are Weston, Ridgefield, Easton, New Canaan, and Madison. In these cities, the violent crime rate is 3 or less per 100,000 people. \n\n#### 6. New Hampshire\n\nNew Hampshireâs score is 61.19, making it the sixth-safest state in the U.S. New Hampshire ranks fourth for Personal \u0026 Residential Safety and fifth for Emergency Preparedness. Additionally, New Hampshire has the third-fewest fatalities per 100 million vehicle miles of travel and the fourth-fewest assaults per capita. As far as Financial Safety, New Hampshire has the second-highest percentage of adults with rainy-day funds and has one of the lowest unemployment rates in the country of 2.6%. \n\n#### 7. Iowa\n\nIowa is the seventh-safest state in the U.S. with a scare of 60.85. Iowa ranks second for Financial Safety and third for both Personal \u0026 Residential Safety and Road Safety. Iowa has the fifth-lowest share of uninsured people in its population. Some of Iowaâs safest cities are Sioux Center, Norwalk, and Eldridge, which are also some of Iowaâs wealthiest cities. It takes some extra resources and funds to make sure communities have proper safety measures.\n\n#### 8. Hawaii\n\nHawaii is the eighth-safest state with a score of 60.29. Hawaii ranks fourth for Emergency Preparedness and sixth for Financial Safety (which is important since Hawaii also has the highest cost of living in the U.S.). Furthermore, Hawaii has the fourth-highest percentage of adults with rainy-day funds and has one of the lowest unemployment rates in the country of 2.7%. Additionally, Hawaii has the second-lowest share of uninsured people in its population.\n\n#### 9. Massachusetts\n\nMassachusettsâs score of 58.98 makes itâs the ninth-safest state in the U.S. Massachusetts ranks first for Financial Safety and second for Road Safety. Furthermore, Massachusetts has the fewest fatalities per 100 million vehicle miles of travel and the fewest share of uninsured people in its population. Massachusetts also has the fourth-lowest bullying incidence rate. \n\n#### 10. Wyoming\n\nFinishing the top ten safest states in the U.S. is Wyoming with a score of 57.31. Wyoming ranks ninth for Personal \u0026 Residential Safety. Wyoming has the smallest population in the country, and with small populations generally comes small crime rates. Residents say you could keep your car keys in the ignition and not have to worry about your car being stolen. Generally, everyone gets along and looks out for one another. \n\n\n\n","data":{"states":[],"customMeta":{"columns":["state",{"header":"Total Safety

lawsuits involving same-sex marriage started in the 1970s, bringing the question of civil marriage rights for same-sex couples to public attention. Many of these lawsuits were unsuccessful.\n\nOn February 12, 2004, the first same-sex marriage in the United States happened in San Francisco, California. Del Martin and Phyllis Lyon become the first gay couple to marry and receive official recognition after being together for 50 years. \n\nOn May 17, 2004, Massachusetts became the first state and sixth jurisdiction in the world to legalize same-sex marriage. Following this, opponents of same-sex marriage began tightening restrictions on marriage, with a number of states approving state constitutional amendments specifically defining marriage as the union of one man and one woman. \n\nIn 2008, California and Connecticut both legalized same-sex marriage, followed by Iowa, Vermont, and New Hampshire. Up until 2012, legalization came through state courts, the enactment of state legislation, or the result of the decisions of federal courts. On November 6, 2012, Maine, Maryland and Washington became the first states to legalize same-sex marriage through popular vote. \n\nOn June 26, 2015, the Supreme Court ruled that it is unconstitutional for states to ban same-sex marriages in the landmark case Obergefell v.

Members of the Republican party see sanctuary states or sanctuary cities as places where illegal immigrants are protected. On the other hand, the Democratic view of sanctuary states are areas where illegal immigrants are protected from aggressive attempts of deportation.\n\nIn general, though, the term sanctuary state means a state that limits its cooperation with federal immigration enforcement agents as much as possible to protect illegal immigrants that have come to this country to make a living. While some illegal immigrants are protected, those that commit serious crimes are turned over to authorities.\n\nSome proponents of sanctuary states and cities believe that the term is misleading, which is why some use the term âsafeâ to replace sanctuary.\n\nWhether you agree with it or not, the fact remains that there are sanctuary cities and sanctuary states in the United States. This has come to light in recent years, as President Donald Trump has aggressively pushed for the removal of all illegal immigrants.\n\nAs of early 2019, there are seven sanctuary states, according to the Center for Immigration Studies.

Throughout history, many people have immigrated to this nation to take advantage of the opportunity to grab a piece of the American dream. Unfortunately, though, not everything that happens in the U.S. is a dream. In fact, there are many recent incidents that have made even going to school a nightmare for students, teachers, and parents across the nation. Those incidents have been school shootings. \n\nSchool shootings are truly a tragedy, bringing death and injuries to learning institutions that were believed to be a safe haven. These school shootings have brought about debates among Americans regarding gun control, mental health issues, bullying, and security. \n\nAlthough these incidents have seemed to be in the news a lot lately, school shootings arenât a new thing. In fact, one of the first reported school shootings occurred during the 1840s when John Anthony Gardner Davis, a professor at the University of Virginia, was shot and killed by his student. Additional shootings in the 1850s included the killing of schoolmaster William H.G. Butler in Louisville, Kentucky, and the death of the son of Col. Elijah Sebree at the hands of another student. \n\nThough school shootings arenât exactly new territory, recent shootings have become more deadly. Incidents include the Parkland, Florida, shootings that killed 17 and injured another 17, the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, which ended with a total of 28 deaths, and the Columbine High School massacre that resulted in the death of 15 people and injured 21. \n\nUnfortunately, some states have seen far more school shootings than others. This data was tracked by the Naval Postgraduate Schoolâs Center for Homeland Defense and Security. In the K-12 School Shooting Database, it shows that California has had the highest number of school shootings since 1970 with a total of 158. The only other state with over 100 school shootings since 1970 was Texas with a total of 133. The state of Florida has had a total of 90 school shootings, Michigan has had 67, and Illinois has had 64. \n\nAll states have had at least one school shooting. The lowest number of school shootings since 1970 have occurred in North Dakota, where there has been just one incident. Wyoming, Vermont, Maine, and Idaho have each had low incidents of school shootings with just two apiece since 1970. \n\nThis list changes a bit when looking at school shootings per capita. Based on the highest rates of school shootings per one million people, Washington, D.C., tops the list with 32.74. Alaska has the next highest shootings per capita at 13.56, followed by Louisiana, Delaware, and Alabama. \n\n","data":{"states":[],"customMeta":{"note":"* Based on publicly available data on incidents from 1970-present.","columns":["state",{"header":"Number of School Shootings","field":"schoolShootings"},"population"],"sortField":"schoolShootings","showAllStates":true,"chloroMap":{"scale":"log","field":"schoolShootings"},"relatedArticles":["death-penalty-states","gun-deaths-by-state","gun-deaths-per-capita-by-state","murder-rate-by-state","executions-by-state","mass-shootings-by-state","school-shootings-by-state","crime-rate-by-state","gun-violence-by-state","prison-population-by-state","human-trafficking-statistics-by-state","most-dangerous-states"]},"customData":[{"schoolShootings":42,"state":"Alabama"},{"schoolShootings":5,"state":"Alaska"},{"schoolShootings":12,"state":"Arizona"},{"schoolShootings":18,"state":"Arkansas"},{"schoolShootings":164,"state":"California"},{"schoolShootings":20,"state":"Colorado"},{"schoolShootings":18,"state":"Connecticut"},{"schoolShootings":8,"state":"Delaware"},{"schoolShootings":90,"state":"Florida"},{"schoolShootings":46,"state":"Georgia"},{"schoolShootings":3,"state":"Hawaii"},{"schoolShootings":2,"state":"Idaho"},{"schoolShootings":65,"state":"Illinois"},{"schoolShootings":24,"state":"Indiana"},{"schoolShootings":12,"state":"Iowa"},{"schoolShootings":10,"state":"Kansas"},{"schoolShootings":14,"state":"Kentucky"},{"schoolShootings":44,"state":"Louisiana"},{"schoolShootings":2,"state":"Maine"},{"schoolShootings":47,"state":"Maryland"},{"schoolShootings":14,"state":"Massachusetts"},{"schoolShootings":70,"state":"Michigan"},{"schoolShootings":12,"state":"Minnesota"},{"schoolShootings":17,"state":"Mississippi"},{"schoolShootings":39,"state":"Missouri"},{"schoolShootings":8,"state":"Montana"},{"schoolShootings":7,"state":"Nebraska"},{"schoolShootings":13,"state":"Nevada"},{"schoolShootings":6,"state":"New Hampshire"},{"schoolShootings":12,"state":"New Jersey"},{"schoolShootings":10,"state":"New Mexico"},{"schoolShootings":49,"state":"New York"},{"schoolShootings":43,"state":"North Carolina"},{"schoolShootings":1,"state":"North Dakota"},{"schoolShootings":55,"state":"Ohio"},{"schoolShootings":11,"state":"Oklahoma"},{"schoolShootings":14,"state":"Oregon"},{"schoolShootings":54,"state":"Pennsylvania"},{"schoolShootings":4,"state":"Rhode Island"},{"schoolShootings":27,"state":"South Carolina"},{"schoolShootings":4,"state":"South Dakota"},{"schoolShootings":46,"state":"Tennessee"},{"schoolShootings":135,"state":"Texas"},{"schoolShootings":13,"state":"Utah"},{"schoolShootings":2,"state":"Vermont"},{"schoolShootings":25,"state":"Virginia"},{"schoolShootings":32,"state":"Washington"},{"schoolShootings":3,"state":"West Virginia"},{"schoolShootings":15,"state":"Wisconsin"},{"schoolShootings":2,"state":"Wyoming"}]},"sources":[{"name":"Factbox: U.S. states with the most and fewest school shootings","link":"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-colorado-shooting-states-factbox/factbox-u-s-states-with-the-most-and-fewest-school-shootings-idUSKCN1SE2EX"}],"lastModified":"2020-04-06T20:09:05.172Z","path":"school-shootings-by-state","name":"School Shootings By State"},{"article":"Seat belts save lives. Seat belts prevent drivers and passengers from being ejecting from the vehicle and from hitting the interior of the vehicle. Additionally, when seat belts are worn properly, they are designed to spread crash forces across stronger parts of the body, such as the shoulder, rib cage, and pelvis.\r\n\r\nFor drivers and front-seat passengers, using a lap and shoulder belt reduces the risk of fatal injury by 60% in an SUV, van, or pickup truck and by 45% in a car. Occupants in a vehicle [increase the risk of injury or death](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1730165/) to other occupants in the vehicle by 40%. \r\n\r\nSeat belts saved an estimated 14,955 lives in 2017s and could have saved an additional 2,456 if everyone buckled their seat belt. Nearly half of people who die in vehicle crashes are not wearing a seat belt.\r\n\r\nSeat belt laws increase seat belt use. Seat belt laws are created to protect the lives of the driver and their passengers. \r\n\r\n## Primary vs. Secondary Enforcement\r\n\r\nIn all 50 states except New Hampshire, failure to wear a seat belt is a misdemeanor. In 34 of those states and the District of Columbia, a driver can be pulled over just for not wearing a seatbelt. This is primary enforcement. \r\n\r\nThe other 15 states with seat belt laws have secondary enforcement, meaning that if a driver gets pulled over for something else, he/she can also get in trouble for not wearing a seat belt. The driver cannot be pulled over by law enforcement and cited solely for not wearing a seat belt in secondary enforcement states, the motorist must be pulled over for another violation first. \r\n\r\n## Laws by State\r\n\r\n#### Alabama\r\n\r\n-\tPrimary enforcement\r\n-\tApplies to ages 15 and over in front seats\r\n-\tBase fine: $25\r\n\r\n#### Alaska\r\n\r\n-\tPrimary enforcement\r\n-\tApplies to ages 16 and over in front seats\r\n-\tBase fine: $15 ($25 actual)\r\n\r\n#### Arizona \r\n\r\n-\tSecondary enforcement\r\n-\tApplies to ages 8 and over in front seats;

With so many freedoms, itâs hard to believe that there was a time in history when a group of people did not have any freedom. These people could not own land, they could not vote, and they worked for no pay and were frequently mistreated. These people â slaves â did not enjoy the freedom and the opportunities of the United States until after the American Civil War.\n\nIn Americaâs early history, all of the British colonies initially allowed slavery. When the original Thirteen Colonies of the United States were established, each permitted slavery. It wasnât until the mid-18th century when political and social movements were created to speak out against slavery. During the American Revolution, thousands of black Americans fought. Many fought against the British in hopes that they would be freed. Others fought with the British army after being offered freedom in exchange for serving in the military.\n\nIt was during the late 17th century that black Americans began petitioning legislatures to abolish slavery. Five northern states agreed to gradually abolish slavery, with Pennsylvania being the first state to approve, followed by New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Rhode Island. By the early 1800s, the northern states had all abolished slavery completely, or they were in the process of gradually eradicating it.\n\nBy the early 1800s, there was an equal number of slave and free states. These states were divided by what became known as the Mason-Dixon line. In 1808, international slave importing was banned but domestic trade will still legal.\n\nAs the United States continued to grow, so did the number of slave states. In 1836, there were 13 slave states and 13 free states. States that allowed slavery included:\n\n- Arkansas\n- Missouri\n- Mississippi\n- Louisiana\n- Alabama\n- Kentucky\n- Tennessee\n- Virginia\n- Maryland\n- Delaware\n- North Carolina\n- South Carolina\n- Alabama\n- Florida at the time was still a territory, and slavery was allowed.\n\nAbout ten years later, the number of slave states rose to 15, outnumbering the 14 free states. The newly added slave states were:\n\n- Florida\n- Texas\n\nIn the late 1850s, the free states finally began to outnumber the 15 slave states. This continued through the early 1860s, when the number of free states rose to 19, while there were still just 15 slave states.\n\nAt the beginning of the Civil War, there were 34 total states in the U.S. Of these states, 15 still allowed slavery. Slavery was the key driver behind the Civil War, with states seceding from the Union and forming the Confederacy. Many states including Maryland, Tennessee, and Missouri abolished slavery before the end of the Civil War. However, some states still allowed slavery until the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution was put into place, entirely abolishing slavery in the nation in 1865.\n","data":{"states":["Alabama","Arkansas","Delaware","Florida","Georgia","Kentucky","Louisiana","Maryland","Mississippi","Missouri","North Carolina","South Carolina","Tennessee","Texas","Virginia"]},"sources":[{"name":"Map of Free and Slave States in 1860","link":"https://herb.ashp.cuny.edu/items/show/2008"}],"lastModified":"2020-04-06T20:09:05.172Z","path":"slave-states","name":"Slave States"},{"article":"Tobacco is the common name of several plants of the Nicotiana genus and is the general term for any product made using cured tobacco leaves, such as cigarettes. Because tobacco contains nicotine, it can become addictive and users often find it difficult to quit using tobacco products.\r\n\r\nAccording to the World Health Organization, tobacco kills more than 8 million people per year, including both smokers and those who are exposed to second-hand smoke. In the United States, tobacco use is the leading cause of preventable death. \r\n\r\nTobacco use increases the risk of several health problems. These include blood clots, coronary heart disease, heart attacks, certain types of cancer, and lung disease. Tobacco use also leads to tooth and gum decay and wrinkled skin. \r\n\r\nAccording to the [Center for Disease Control](https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/disparities/low-ses/index.htm) (CDC), there are disparities in tobacco use between socioeconomic classes. âIn the U.S., people living below the poverty level and people having lower levels of educational attainment have higher rates of cigarette smoking than the general population.â Additionally, those in lower-income areas have less access to primary health care and health insurance, and fewer resources to help them quick smoking, increasing their chances of being diagnosed with later stages of cancer and diseases from smoking. The tobacco industry also systematically target low-income populations and specific demographics with price discounts, direct-mail marketing, and in-store promotions. \r\n\r\nThe ten states with the highest rates of tobacco use are:\r\n\r\n1.\tWest Virginia (26.00%)\r\n2.\tKentucky (24.60%)\r\n3.\tLouisiana (23.10%)\r\n4.\tTennessee (22.60%)\r\n5.\tArkansas (22.30%)\r\n6.\tMississippi (22.20%)\r\n7.\tIndiana (21.80%)\r\n8.\tOhio (21.10%)\r\n9.\tAlaska (21.00%)\r\n10.\tAlabama (20.90%)\r\n\r\nWest Virginia has the highest rate of tobacco use at 26%. People living in rural areas are more likely to smoke than others and are more likely to consume more than 15 cigarettes per day, according to an analysis by the [American Lung Association](https://www.lung.org/assets/documents/research/cutting-tobaccos-rural-roots.pdf). West Virginia, and many of the top ten states, all have vast rural areas. \r\n\r\nThe ten states with the lowest rates of tobacco use are:\r\n\r\n1.\tUtah (8.90%)\r\n2.\tPuerto Rico (11.30%)\r\n3.\tCalifornia (11.30%)\r\n4.\tConnecticut (12.70%)\r\n5.\tHawaii (12.80%)\r\n6.\tWashington (13.50%)\r\n7.\tMassachusetts (13.70%)\r\n8.\tNew Jersey (13.70%)\r\n9.\tMaryland (13.80%)\r\n10.\tNew York (14.10%)\r\n\r\nUtah has the lowest rate of tobacco use in the United States at 8.9%. Utah is the only state to have a tobacco usage rate in the single digits. Throughout the United States, however, tobacco use has been decreasing over the years thanks to smoke-free policies; increased support and programs to help people quit smoking; and campaigns spreading the awareness of health risks associated with tobacco use.\r\n\r\nBelow is a table of each stateâs rate of tobacco use.\r\n","data":{"states":[],"customMeta":{"columns":["state",{"header":"Number of Smoking Adults","field":"smokingRate","format":"percAlt"},"population"],"sortField":"smokingRate","showAllStates":true,"chloroMap":{"field":"smokingRate"},"relatedArticles":["abortion-rates-by-state","autism-rates-by-state","birth-rate-by-state","cancer-rates-by-state","circumcision-rates-by-state","corporate-tax-rates-by-state","crime-rate-by-state","depression-rates-by-state","employment-rate-by-state","flu-rates-by-state","infant-mortality-rate-by-state","labor-force-participation-rate-by-state","maternal-mortality-rate-by-state","murder-rate-by-state","obesity-rate-by-state","smoking-rates-by-state","state-tax-rates","suicide-rates-by-state","teen-pregnancy-rates-by-state","unemployment-rate-by-state","us-literacy-rates-by-state","vaccination-rates-by-state"]},"customData":[{"state":"Alabama","smokingRate":20.9},{"state":"Alaska","smokingRate":21},{"state":"Arizona","smokingRate":15.6},{"state":"Arkansas","smokingRate":22.3},{"state":"California","smokingRate":11.3},{"state":"Colorado","smokingRate":14.6},{"state":"Connecticut","smokingRate":12.7},{"state":"Delaware","smokingRate":17},{"state":"District of Columbia","smokingRate":14.3},{"state":"Florida","smokingRate":16.1},{"state":"Georgia","smokingRate":17.5},{"state":"Guam","smokingRate":26.4},{"state":"Hawaii","smokingRate":12.8},{"state":"Idaho","smokingRate":14.3},{"state":"Illinois","smokingRate":15.5},{"state":"Indiana","smokingRate":21.8},{"state":"Iowa","smokingRate":17.1},{"state":"Kansas","smokingRate":17.4},{"state":"Kentucky","smokingRate":24.6},{"state":"Louisiana","smokingRate":23.1},{"state":"Maine","smokingRate":17.3},{"state":"Maryland","smokingRate":13.8},{"state":"Massachusetts","smokingRate":13.7},{"state":"Michigan","smokingRate":19.3},{"state":"Minnesota","smokingRate":14.5},{"state":"Mississippi","smokingRate":22.2},{"state":"Missouri","smokingRate":20.8},{"state":"Montana","smokingRate":17.2},{"state":"Nebraska","smokingRate":15.4},{"state":"Nevada","smokingRate":17.6},{"state":"New Hampshire","smokingRate":15.7},{"state":"New Jersey","smokingRate":13.7},{"state":"New Mexico","smokingRate":17.5},{"state":"New York","smokingRate":14.1},{"state":"North Carolina","smokingRate":17.2},{"state":"North Dakota","smokingRate":18.3},{"state":"Ohio","smokingRate":21.1},{"state":"Oklahoma","smokingRate":20.1},{"state":"Oregon","smokingRate":16.1},{"state":"Pennsylvania","smokingRate":18.7},{"state":"Puerto Rico","smokingRate":11.3},{"state":"Rhode Island","smokingRate":14.9},{"state":"South Carolina","smokingRate":18.8},{"state":"South Dakota","smokingRate":19.3},{"state":"Tennessee","smokingRate":22.6},{"state":"Texas","smokingRate":15.7},{"state":"Utah","smokingRate":8.9},{"state":"Vermont","smokingRate":15.8},{"state":"Virginia","smokingRate":16.4},{"state":"Washington","smokingRate":13.5},{"state":"West Virginia","smokingRate":26},{"state":"Wisconsin","smokingRate":16},{"state":"Wyoming","smokingRate":18.7}]},"sources":[{"name":"Current Cigarette Use Among Adults (Behavior Risk Factor Surveillance System) 2017","link":"https://www.cdc.gov/statesystem/cigaretteuseadult.html"}],"lastModified":"2020-04-06T20:09:05.172Z","path":"smoking-rates-by-state","name":"Smoking Rates By State"},{"article":"Citizens and permanent residents of the United States are issued a Social Security number by the Social Security Administration. Your Social Security number â or SSN, for short â is a nine-digit unique identifier that is used for a number of purposes. The most common way that this number is used is for tracking citizens and residents for Social Security purposes. However, your Social Security number can also be used for taxation, applying for credit, and other purposes. \n\nAs mentioned, the SSN consists of nine numbers. These numbers are broken into three parts. The first three numbers are the area number. Until 2011, this number corresponded with the state or territory in which the number was assigned. However, after 2011, numbers were assigned at random. \n\nThe next set of numbers consists of two digits. This set is known as group numbers and does not relate to geographical location. \n\nFinally, the last set of numbers consists of four digits. This is a number that goes in order from 0001 to 9999. \n\nAny Social Security number issued prior to 2011 can be evaluated to determine where the number was issued. To learn where a Social Security number was issued, look at the area number â the first three digits. Then, match these numbers with the following.

Other definitions also include Delaware, Maryland, and the District of Columbia. \n \nThe Southeastern United States has a total area of over 580,000 square miles with a population of over 97 million. The population density is just over 150 people per square mile. \n \nThe most populous state in the region is Florida, which has an estimated population of nearly 21 million people. Other populous states include Georgia, which has a population of over 10.4 million, North Carolina, which has a population of over 10.27 million, and Virginia, with a population of over 8.47 million. \n \nThe least populous state in the Southeast is West Virginia, which has a population of 1.8 million, followed by Mississippi with a population of 2.98 million. Arkansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, and Alabama are also among the least populous southeastern states with populations that each fall below 5 million per the latest estimates. \n \nThe largest city in the Southeast is Jacksonville, Florida, which has a population of over 868,000. Other populous cities include Charlotte, North Carolina; Washington, D.C.; Nashville, Tennessee; Memphis, Tennessee; and Baltimore, Maryland. \n\n","data":{"states":["Alabama","Florida","Georgia","Kentucky","Maryland","Mississippi","North Carolina","South Carolina","Tennessee","Virginia","West Virginia"],"customMeta":{"relatedArticles":["bible-belt-states","border-states","coastal-states",{"link":"4-corners-states","title":"Four Corners States"},"east-coast-states","eastern-states","flyover-states","gulf-states","great-lakes-states","lower-48-states",{"link":"midwest-states","title":"Midwestern United States"},{"link":"mid-atlantic-states","title":"Mid-Atlantic States"},"mountain-states","new-england-states","northern-states","rust-belt-states","southeast-states","southwest-states","west-coast-states"]}},"sources":[{"name":"What is SEDAAG?","link":"https://sedaag.org/"}],"lastModified":"2020-04-06T20:09:05.172Z","path":"southeast-states","name":"Southeast States"},{"article":"The Southwestern states â or, simply, the Southwest â is a region that is located in the western region of the United States. Since this in an informal region, exact boundaries vary. Depending on what definition you use, as few as two states or as many as eight states make up this region. \n\nThe states of Arizona and New Mexico are said to be the core of the region. No matter what boundaries are used, these two states are always considered southwest states. The six additional states that may or may not be included in the definition of the southwest states are: \n\nCalifornia\nColorado\nNevada\nOklahoma\nTexas\nUtah\n\nPer the last U.S. census taken in 2010, Nevada was the fastest-growing state in the nation. Other southwestern states including Texas, Colorado, and Arizona were among the top ten fastest-growing states per the census.\n\nSome of the largest cities in the world are located in the southwest region. Las Vegas, Nevada, and Albuquerque, New Mexico, are two of the fastest-growing cities in the nation. \n\nPhoenix, Arizona, the largest metropolitan area, has a population of about 4 million. Las Vegas (population of over 2 million) and Tucson (population of over 1 million) are also large metro areas located in this region. The city of Phoenix is also the largest city in the southwest and is the only city with a population of more than 1 million. \n\nOne of the characteristics of the southwestern states are that they are ethnically diverse. African Americans, Asians, American Indians, and Hispanic Americans are among the groups that live in the southwest. Southwestern cities including San Antonio, Texas; Albuquerque, New Mexico; Mesa, Arizona; and El Paso, Texas, have large populations of Mexican Americans and Spanish Americans. \n\nAnother standout feature of the southwestern states are the national parks and monuments. One of the most notable is the Grand Canyon, which is located in Arizona. Other significant landmarks include Californiaâs Death Valley National Park, Coloradoâs Great Sand Dunes National Park, and Texasâ Big Bend National Park.\n\n","data":{"states":["California","Colorado","Nevada","Oklahoma","Texas","Utah"],"customMeta":{"relatedArticles":["bible-belt-states","border-states","coastal-states",{"link":"4-corners-states","title":"Four Corners States"},"east-coast-states","eastern-states","flyover-states","gulf-states","great-lakes-states","lower-48-states",{"link":"midwest-states","title":"Midwestern United States"},{"link":"mid-atlantic-states","title":"Mid-Atlantic States"},"mountain-states","new-england-states","northern-states","rust-belt-states","southeast-states","southwest-states","west-coast-states"]}},"sources":[{"name":"Southwest Region, United States","link":"https://www.britannica.com/place/Southwest-region"}],"lastModified":"2020-04-06T20:09:05.172Z","path":"southwest-states","name":"Southwest States"},{"article":"Speed limits are restrictions on the minimum and maximum speeds vehicles may travel on a given stretch of road. Speed limits are designated by signs and are used in many countries. In the United States, speed limits are used to protect drivers and regulate unruly or dangerous behavior on the roads.\r\n\r\nThere is no guarantee that posting speed limits has any effect on driver behaviors, as most drivers will ultimately travel at the speed that they feel the most comfortable going. However, law enforcement does monitor the speed of motorists and failure to adhere to posted speed limits can result in fines and, depending on how fast a driver is going, arrest. \r\n\r\nSpeed limits vary between states and are often different for rural interstates, urban interstates, and other types of roads. Montana has different speed limits for day and night on certain types of roads. Some states, such as California and Arkansas, have different speed limits for trucks and cars.\r\n\r\nThere are three main categories of roads: arterial, collector and local. Arterial roads have higher speeds and fewer access points, such as on- and off-ramps. Collector roads have high speeds and are balanced to have more access points. Local roads have lower speeds and more access points, such as intersections and cross streets. The difference between these three types of streets is the reason why there are different speed limits. Roads with fewer travelers and fewer vehicles attempting to cross one another can sustain higher speeds, while roads with more volume of travelers and have more bikers or pedestrians need to have lower speeds.\r\n\r\nSouth Dakota has the highest speed limits in the United States. Rural and urban interstates both have a speed limit of 80 miles per hour and other roads are posted at 70 miles per hour. Hawaii has the overall lowest speed limits in the United States. Rural and urban interstates in Hawaii have a speed limit of 60 miles per hour and other roads are posted at 45 miles per hour.\r\n\r\nBelow is a table with each stateâs speed limits for rural

Kansas (Population density: 36 people per square mile)\n\nFor those who enjoy wide open spaces, the United States offers plenty of options. The large states of Alaska, Wyoming, and Montana have the lowest population densities in the country, with Montana having 7p/miÂ² in a population of 1,062,330, Wyoming 6p/miÂ² with a population of just 573,720 (also the lowest population in the country), and Alaska topping them all with only 1p/miÂ² relative to its population of 738,068 and total area of 570,641miÂ².\n\nIn comparison to the other states, the District of Columbia covers a tiny area of just 61miÂ², yet it has a population of 703,608 which makes it by far the densest state of all at 11,535p/miÂ².

California has a total population of 39,776,830, and a population density of 255p/miÂ², Texas has a population of 28,704,330 and its population density is a relatively low 110p/miÂ² (although this is due to it also being one of the largest states at 261,232miÂ²), while Florida's population of 21,312,211 has a population density of 397p/miÂ². These numbers likely reflect the fact that some states have particularly populous cities, which is likely to skew the statistics somewhat â for example, New York has a total population of 19,862,512 and a population density of 421p/miÂ², but New York City is also the most highly populated city in the United States.\n","frontmatter":{"title":"United States by Density","date":"2018-11-8","description":"The United States contains a variety of population densities."},"data":{"customMeta":{"columns":["state","density","population","area"],"sortField":"Density","sortAsc":false,"showAllstates":true,"chloroMap":{"field":"Density","scale":"log"}}},"sources":[{"name":"US Census State Population Estimates","link":"https://www.census.gov/data/tables/2016/demo/popest/state-total.html","description":"Most recent state estimates from the Census Bureau's Population Estimates Program"}],"lastModified":"2020-04-06T20:09:26.812Z","path":"state-densities","name":"State Densities"},{"article":"The [mottos](https://statesymbolsusa.org/categories/state-motto) of all fifty states in the US are representative of what each state values the most.

The state governments, on the other hand, arenât as powerful as the federal government. However, their power is significant within each state.\n\nState governments operate similarly to the federal government, but the only difference is they have more power over the state. They also have a similar structure to the federal government, with each state possessing a legislative, executive, and judicial branch. Any action or ability that isnât given to the federal government is handed down to the state governments, which then divides into the three central powers/branches.\n\n## Legislative\nThe legislative branch is comprised of two parts: the House of Representatives and the Senate. These two parties are part of the bicameral legislature in each state - except Nebraska, which has one - and they both work together to achieve common goals, including: \n\n- Making laws\n- Approving state budgets\n- Bringing forth tax legislation\n- Drafting articles of impeachment\n\nIn the federal government, the legislative branch is responsible for the same duties. The only difference is that Congress is made of both members from the House of Representatives and the Senate. They all end up coming together to make the countryâs laws. \n\n## Executive\nThe executive branch is the entity that performs one duty: enforce approved laws. Itâs generally run by a governor, who also works alongside his/her executive officers and agencies to get the job done. \n\nThe citizens of the state usually elect these members of the branch. Although this is a general way to pick who is enforcing the laws in each state, the executive legislation within each state is not the same.\n\nThe federal government, on the other hand, performs the same duties. They play a slightly more significant role, though, because this branch is enforcing laws throughout the country. The positions are also somewhat different as this entity contains members like:\n\n- The President\n- The Vice President\n- The Cabinet\n- Some other federal agencies\n\n## Judicial\nThe judicial branch has the help of the state supreme court and other municipal courts to interpret and evaluate the laws in place today. In the state, these court systems are used to bring forth matters related to regulations affecting the state. \n\nSometimes, when people arenât happy with the results they get from the state courts, they will appeal the judgment to the Court of Appeals, then the U.S. Supreme Court. The U.S. Supreme Court is the court that the federal government uses to make any corrections to mistakes that the lower courts have made.\n\nUnlike the state government, the federal government has the help of the Supreme Court and other higher appointed courts to make their decisions about laws. The judges for these courts are chosen based on who the President decides, and they are appointed for life. Judges for state governments, on the other hand, are selected by the state legislature.\n","lastModified":"2020-04-20T13:36:55.346Z","path":"state-powers","name":"State Powers"},{"article":"The World's Fair of 1893 was held in Chicago. In preparation for the event, there was something called the National Garland of Flowers that was created for the sake of representing every US state at the World's Fair. The garland was comprised of flowers for each of the fifty states, and at the time, the flowers were not necessarily considered state symbols. Instead, the National Garland of Flowers inspired the concept of state symbols. From there, state symbols such as trees, birds, songs, and, of course, flowers were born. \n\nBelieve it or not, even though state symbols seem mighty official, there is no actual process for selecting the state symbols in America. Take the official state dog of the state of Delaware as a perfect example. \n\nOn August 3 of 2016, the official [state dog of Delaware](https://statesymbolsusa.org/symbol-official-item/delaware/dogs-cats-mammals/golden-retriever) was announced, making the golden retriever the state dog of Delaware. The way the state dog was selected was very simple and quite humorous. A group of fourth graders sent in letters to Delaware legislators, pleading with them to make the golden retriever the state's official dog. \n\nThey had been learning about state symbols in school at the time, and one of their class assignments was to mail letters to the government regarding the state symbols. The lawmakers received the letters and put their plea to a vote, which ultimately resulted in the golden retriever becoming the official state dog of Delaware.\n\nAnother example of the casual ways by which state symbols are chosen has to do with the [official state dinosaur](https://statesymbolsusa.org/symbol-official-item/arkansas/dinosaurs-fossils/arkansaurus-fridayi) of the state of Arkansas. In 2013, a boy by the name of Mason Cypress Oury of Fayetteville County decided to embark on a campaign. He wanted the state dinosaur of Arkansas to officially be named as the Arkansaurus fridayi. Using social media, Oury was able to spread the word and the governor of Arkansas, Governor Hutchinson, signed a document that officially made the Arkansaurus fridayi the state dinosaur in 2017.\n\nWithout further ado, here are the [state symbols](https://www.infoplease.com/us/states/state-symbols) of the United States of America.

Taxes are used to fund a number of public expenditures, such as roads, public transportation, education, and others. When expenditures exceed tax revenue, the government goes into debt.\r\n\r\nTaxes have two effects:\r\n\r\n-\tAn income effect because they reduce purchasing power to taxpayers (income tax)\r\n-\tA substitution effect when taxes cause a substitution between taxed goods and untaxed goods (sales tax)\r\n\r\nFederal income tax is the tax levied by the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) on the earnings of individuals and legal entities. However, most states collect state income and sales taxes in addition to the federal income tax. State taxes are given little attention compared to federal income taxes.\r\n\r\nStates take one of three approaches when it comes to state income taxes:\r\n\r\n-\tThe state does not collect income tax\r\n-\tThe state imposes a flat tax, taxing all income (or only dividends and interest) at the same rate\r\n-\tThe state imposes a progressive tax which taxes higher income at higher rates\r\n\r\nFirst, there are seven states that do not collect a state income tax. While these states do not have an additional income tax, other taxes, such as property or sales taxes, could be higher in these states. The seven states are:\r\n\r\n-\tAlaska\r\n-\tFlorida\r\n-\tNevada\r\n-\tSouth Dakota\r\n-\tTexas\r\n-\tWashington\r\n-\tWyoming\r\n\r\nSecond, there are eleven states with flat income tax rates. In New Hampshire and Tennessee, the tax rate applies to dividends and interest income and regular income is typically not subject to state tax. These states are:\r\n\r\n-\tColorado (4.63%)\r\n-\tIllinois (4.95%)\r\n-\tIndiana (3.23%)\r\n-\tKentucky (5%)\r\n-\tMassachusetts (5.05%)\r\n-\tMichigan (4.25%)\r\n-\tNew Hampshire (5%)\r\n-\tNorth Carolina (5.25%)\r\n-\tPennsylvania (3.07%)\r\n-\tTennessee (2%)\r\n-\tUtah (4.95%)\r\n\r\nThe remaining states and the District of Columbia have state income tax brackets. The higher an individualâs income, the higher the tax bracket he/she will be placed into. California has the highest potential state income tax bracket of 13%.\r\n\r\nBelow is a table with each stateâs lowest and highest state income tax bracket. \r\n","data":{"states":[],"customMeta":{"columns":["state",{"header":"Income Tax Lowest Bracket","field":"lowestIncomeTaxBracket","format":"perc"},{"header":"Income Tax Highest Bracket","field":"highestIncomeTaxBracket","format":"perc"},"population"],"showAllStates":true,"sortField":"State","sortAsc":true,"chloroMap":{"field":"highestIncomeTaxBracket"},"relatedArticles":["alcohol-tax-by-state","corporate-tax-rates-by-state","income-tax-by-state","sales-tax-by-state","states-that-dont-tax-pensions","states-with-lowest-taxes","taxes-on-lottery-winnings-by-state","capital-gains-tax-by-state","gas-taxes-by-state","property-taxes-by-state","state-tax-rates","states-that-tax-social-security","states-with-no-income-tax","tax-burden-by-state","car-sales-tax-by-state","highest-taxed-states","retirement-taxes-by-state","states-that-dont-tax-military-retirement","states-with-internet-sales-tax",{"link":"states-without-property-tax","title":"States With No Property Tax"},"taxes-by-state"]},"customData":[{"state":"Alabama","lowestIncomeTaxBracket":0.02,"highestIncomeTaxBracket":0.05},{"state":"Arizona","lowestIncomeTaxBracket":0.0259,"highestIncomeTaxBracket":0.0454},{"state":"Arkansas","lowestIncomeTaxBracket":0.009000000000000001,"highestIncomeTaxBracket":0.069},{"state":"California","lowestIncomeTaxBracket":0.01,"highestIncomeTaxBracket":0.133},{"state":"Connecticut","lowestIncomeTaxBracket":0.03,"highestIncomeTaxBracket":0.0699},{"state":"Delaware","lowestIncomeTaxBracket":0.022000000000000002,"highestIncomeTaxBracket":0.066},{"state":"Georgia","lowestIncomeTaxBracket":0.01,"highestIncomeTaxBracket":0.06},{"state":"Hawaii","lowestIncomeTaxBracket":0.013999999999999999,"highestIncomeTaxBracket":0.0825},{"state":"Idaho","lowestIncomeTaxBracket":0.016,"highestIncomeTaxBracket":0.07400000000000001},{"state":"Iowa","lowestIncomeTaxBracket":0.0036,"highestIncomeTaxBracket":0.0898},{"state":"Kansas","lowestIncomeTaxBracket":0.028999999999999998,"highestIncomeTaxBracket":0.052000000000000005},{"state":"Kentucky","lowestIncomeTaxBracket":0.02,"highestIncomeTaxBracket":0.06},{"state":"Louisiana","lowestIncomeTaxBracket":0.02,"highestIncomeTaxBracket":0.06},{"state":"Maine","lowestIncomeTaxBracket":0.057999999999999996,"highestIncomeTaxBracket":0.07150000000000001},{"state":"Maryland","lowestIncomeTaxBracket":0.02,"highestIncomeTaxBracket":0.0575},{"state":"Minnesota","lowestIncomeTaxBracket":0.0535,"highestIncomeTaxBracket":0.09849999999999999},{"state":"Mississippi","lowestIncomeTaxBracket":0.03,"highestIncomeTaxBracket":0.05},{"state":"Missouri","lowestIncomeTaxBracket":0.015,"highestIncomeTaxBracket":0.06},{"state":"Montana","lowestIncomeTaxBracket":0.01,"highestIncomeTaxBracket":0.069},{"state":"Nebraska","lowestIncomeTaxBracket":0.0246,"highestIncomeTaxBracket":0.0684},{"state":"New Jersey","lowestIncomeTaxBracket":0.013999999999999999,"highestIncomeTaxBracket":0.0897},{"state":"New Mexico","lowestIncomeTaxBracket":0.017,"highestIncomeTaxBracket":0.049},{"state":"New York","lowestIncomeTaxBracket":0.04,"highestIncomeTaxBracket":0.0882},{"state":"North Dakota","lowestIncomeTaxBracket":0.011000000000000001,"highestIncomeTaxBracket":0.028999999999999998},{"state":"Ohio","lowestIncomeTaxBracket":0.005,"highestIncomeTaxBracket":0.05},{"state":"Oklahoma","lowestIncomeTaxBracket":0.005,"highestIncomeTaxBracket":0.05},{"state":"Oregon","lowestIncomeTaxBracket":0.05,"highestIncomeTaxBracket":0.099},{"state":"Rhode Island","lowestIncomeTaxBracket":0.0375,"highestIncomeTaxBracket":0.0599},{"state":"South Carolina","lowestIncomeTaxBracket":0,"highestIncomeTaxBracket":0.07},{"state":"Vermont","lowestIncomeTaxBracket":0.0355,"highestIncomeTaxBracket":0.0895},{"state":"Virginia","lowestIncomeTaxBracket":0.02,"highestIncomeTaxBracket":0.0575},{"state":"West Virginia","lowestIncomeTaxBracket":0.03,"highestIncomeTaxBracket":0.065},{"state":"Wisconsin","lowestIncomeTaxBracket":0.04,"highestIncomeTaxBracket":0.0765},{"state":"District of Columbia","lowestIncomeTaxBracket":0.04,"highestIncomeTaxBracket":0.0895}]},"sources":[{"name":"State and Local Sales Tax Rates 2018","link":"https://taxfoundation.org/state-and-local-sales-tax-rates-2018/"}],"lastModified":"2020-04-11T03:11:14.692Z","path":"state-tax-rates","name":"State Tax Rates"},{"article":"What is the largest state by area in the United States of America? Here is a list of the top ten biggest states by size:\n\n1. Alaska (Total area: 665,384 square miles)\n2. Texas (Total area: 268,596 square miles)\n3. California (Total area: 163,696 square miles)\n4. Montana (Total area: 147,040 square miles)\n5. New Mexico (Total area: 121,590 square miles)\n6. Arizona (Total area: 113,990 square miles)\n7.

Wyoming (Total area: 97,813 square miles)\n\nThe United States has a diverse climate, and this reflected in the landscape of the country. Not surprisingly, Alaska and Texas are the largest states by area, although Alaska, at 665,384 miÂ², is substantially larger than Texas at 268,596 miÂ². Alaska is made up of 85.76% land, while water covers an area of 94,743 miÂ² (the highest in the US). However, the much dryer southern state of Texas consists of 97.26 miÂ² of land and has only 7,365 miÂ² of water. Other states with arid climates are similar: New Mexico and Arizona are almost entirely comprised of land (99.76% and 99.65%, respectively) with very little water.\n\nMany states have large areas of water. These include the states of Michigan (40,175 miÂ²) and Wisconsin (11,339 miÂ²) in the Great Lakes region of the northern US, and the humid Gulf States of Florida (12,133 miÂ²) and Louisiana (9,174 miÂ²). There are of course many other states that may not have vast areas of water within the state, but which are Ocean-facing (such as Georgia), as well as states that have small areas of water in terms of percentage, but the numbers simply reflect the size of the state itself (for example, tiny Rhode Island with its 511 miÂ² of water).\n\nThe smallest states by area are of course the District of Columbia at just 68 miÂ² and Rhode Island at 1,545 miÂ². Interestingly, there are only a handful of tiny states; Delaware, Connecticut, New Jersey, New Hampshire, and Vermont are the only other states with a total area of under 10,000 miÂ² and the numbers increase significantly from that point onwards, emphasizing just how large the United States as a country is.\n","frontmatter":{"title":"United States by Area","date":"2018-11-8","description":"Areas of the United States"},"data":{"customMeta":{"columns":["state","totalArea","area","waterArea","density","population"],"sortField":"TotalArea","sortAsc":false,"showAllstates":true}},"lastModified":"2020-04-06T20:09:26.812Z","path":"states-by-area","name":"States By Area"},{"article":"The United States of America was established in July 1776 when the first 13 states â then known as individual colonies â agreed to the United States Declaration of Independence. The first state to join the union was Delaware, which ratified the 1787 Constitution (which created the federal union of states that exists today) on December 7, 1787. Pennsylvania closely followed it on December 7, 1787, and New Jersey on December 18, 1787. A further ten states along the eastern seaboard made up the original 13 states of the United States of America â Rhode Island was the last of these to join in May 1790.  \n\nOver the next 20 years, a further 11 states joined the union, including Ohio (1803), Louisiana (1812), and Maine (1820). There was then a gap of 15 years before the next state joined â this was Arkansas in June 1836. Two of today's most populous states, Texas and California, joined in 1845 and 1850, respectively. By the end of the 19th century, the majority of the states that make up the current union had joined. Utah was the last 19th-century state to join in January 1896.\n\nThroughout the 20th century, only a further five states would join the union. These were Oklahoma in November 1907, New Mexico in January 1912, and Arizona in February 1912, while Alaska and Hawaii â the only two non-continental states â joined as recently as 1959, taking the total number of states in the union to 50. Today, Americans are citizens of both the state in which they live as well as the Federal Republic of the United States.

Both military disability retirement pay and veteranâs benefits, including service-connected disability pension payments, are typically excluded from taxable income. \r\n\r\nUnderstanding military retirement income taxes helps one better plan their retirement years, as these taxes can have a large impact on oneâs financial plans and goals. \r\n\r\nGenerally, in order to be eligible for military retirement benefits, one needs to serve for 20 years. Military retirement pay is not considered earned income and no Social Security is withheld. \r\n\r\nLaws vary greatly between states. Some states do not tax military retirement pay, and some states have specific tax exemption, such as exempting taxation up to a certain amount or being exempt depending on age or year of retirement. In Arizona, for example, up to $2,500 in military retirement pay can be exempted from taxable income. In Kentucky, military pensions are fully exempt if the person retired before 1997.\r\n\r\nThe states can be divided into four categories: no state income tax; exempts military pension income from state taxes; offers special tax treatments for military pensions, and treats military retirement pay as ordinary taxable income. \r\n\r\nThe following states have state income tax but exempt military retirement pay:\r\n\r\n-\tAlabama\r\n-\tArkansas\r\n-\tConnecticut\r\n-\tHawaii\r\n-\tIllinois\r\n-\tIowa \r\n-\tKansas\r\n-\tLouisiana\r\n-\tMaine\r\n-\tMassachusetts\r\n-\tMichigan\r\n-\tMinnesota\r\n-\tMississippi\r\n-\tMissouri\r\n-\tNew Jersey\r\n-\tNew York\r\n-\tOhio\r\n-\tPennsylvania\r\n-\tWisconsin\r\n\r\nThe following states have no state income tax, and, therefore, do not tax military retirement pay:\r\n\r\n-\tAlaska\r\n-\tFlorida\r\n-\tNevada\r\n-\tNew Hampshire\r\n-\tSouth Dakota\r\n-\tTennessee\r\n-\tTexas\r\n-\tWashington\r\n-\tWyoming\r\n\r\nBelow is a table of each stateâs treatment of military retirement pay.\r\n","data":{"states":["Alabama","Arkansas","Connecticut","Hawaii","Illinois","Kansas","Louisiana","Massachusetts","Michigan","Mississippi","New Jersey","New York","Ohio","Pennsylvania","Wisconsin"],"customMeta":{"columns":["state",{"header":"Military Retirement Pay Tax Info","field":"militaryPensionTax"},"population"],"sortField":"State","sortAsc":true,"showAllStates":true,"relatedArticles":["alcohol-tax-by-state","corporate-tax-rates-by-state","income-tax-by-state","sales-tax-by-state","states-that-dont-tax-pensions","states-with-lowest-taxes","taxes-on-lottery-winnings-by-state","capital-gains-tax-by-state","gas-taxes-by-state","property-taxes-by-state","state-tax-rates","states-that-tax-social-security","states-with-no-income-tax","tax-burden-by-state","car-sales-tax-by-state","highest-taxed-states","retirement-taxes-by-state","states-that-dont-tax-military-retirement","states-with-internet-sales-tax",{"link":"states-without-property-tax","title":"States With No Property Tax"},"taxes-by-state"]},"customData":[{"state":"Alabama","militaryPensionTax":"Military Retirement Pay Exempt"},{"state":"Alaska","militaryPensionTax":"No State Income Tax"},{"state":"Arizona","militaryPensionTax":"Up to $2,500 in military retirement pay can be exempted from taxable income."},{"state":"Arkansas","militaryPensionTax":"Military Retirement Pay Exempt"},{"state":"California","militaryPensionTax":"No Special Tax Treatment of Military Retirement Pay"},{"state":"Colorado","militaryPensionTax":"The following military pension amounts can be excluded from Colorado income, based upon age: $20,000 (55-64); $24,000 (65+)"},{"state":"Connecticut","militaryPensionTax":"Military Retirement Pay Exempt"},{"state":"Delaware","militaryPensionTax":"The following military pension amounts can be excluded from Delaware income, based upon age: $2,000 (Under 60); $12,500 (60+)"},{"state":"Florida","militaryPensionTax":"No State Income Tax"},{"state":"Georgia","militaryPensionTax":"No Special Tax Treatment of Military Retirement Pay"},{"state":"Hawaii","militaryPensionTax":"Military Retirement Pay Exempt"},{"state":"Idaho","militaryPensionTax":"Military pensions are partially exempted according to the following table: - Married Filing Jointly (must be either 65+ or 62+ and disabled): $47,934 - Single (must be either 65+ or 62+ and disabled): $31,956"},{"state":"Illinois","militaryPensionTax":"Military Retirement Pay Exempt"},{"state":"Indiana","militaryPensionTax":"Military retirees 60 and older are allowed to deduct up to $5,000 of their pension."},{"state":"Iowa","militaryPensionTax":"Military Retirement Pay Exempt"},{"state":"Kansas","militaryPensionTax":"Military Retirement Pay Exempt"},{"state":"Kentucky","militaryPensionTax":"Military pensions are fully exempt if you retired before 1997.

After nearly a lifetime of work, many Americans get to finally cash in on their retirement plan, like a pension plan. \n \nA pension plan is a type of retirement plan that is made up of contributions from the employer. In some cases, the employee may also be able to contribute to the plan, and the employer can make these funds up to a set limit or certain percentage. \n \nA pension plan assures a person that he or she will be able to have an income following retirement. Unfortunately, though, in many states, pension funds can be taxed just like ordinary income. \n \nLaws vary from state to state regarding how pensions are taxed. In some cases, at least a portion is taxed based on the amount of money in the plan and the age of the retiree. However, in other states, pensions arenât taxed at all. Letâs take a look at the states that donât tax pensions. \n \n- Alabama: This state doesnât tax pension income from defined benefit retirement plans. \n- Alaska: Because Alaska doesnât have an income tax, you wonât pay taxes on your pension or other income. \n- Florida: Like Alaska, Florida doesnât have an income tax, so your pension will not be taxed. \n- Hawaii: Public and private pensions arenât taxed in Hawaii with one exception. Any portion that you contributed will be taxed. \n- Illinois: Private pensions from qualified employee benefit plans are exempt from taxation in Illinois. \n- Mississippi: Pensions used after the age of 59.5 are not taxed in Mississippi. \n- Nevada: No income tax in Nevada means that your pension will not be taxed after retirement. \n- New Hampshire: New Hampshire is another state with no income taxes, so there is no tax on pension income. There is, however, taxes on interest and dividends. \n- Pennsylvania: The only time pensions are taxed in this state is when you retire early. \n- South Dakota: There are no income taxes in the state of South Dakota. \n- Tennessee: Taxes are only paid on interest and dividends in this state, not on pensions. \n- Texas: No personal income tax means that Texans can hold onto their pension funds. \n- Washington: Washington is another state without an income tax. \n- Wyoming: Like many other states on this list, Wyoming does not have an income tax. \n\n","data":{"states":["Alabama","Alaska","Florida","Hawaii","Illinois","Mississippi","Nevada","New Hampshire","Pennsylvania","South Dakota","Tennessee","Texas","Washington","Wyoming"],"customMeta":{"relatedArticles":["alcohol-tax-by-state","corporate-tax-rates-by-state","income-tax-by-state","sales-tax-by-state","states-that-dont-tax-pensions","states-with-lowest-taxes","taxes-on-lottery-winnings-by-state","capital-gains-tax-by-state","gas-taxes-by-state","property-taxes-by-state","state-tax-rates","states-that-tax-social-security","states-with-no-income-tax","tax-burden-by-state","car-sales-tax-by-state","highest-taxed-states","retirement-taxes-by-state","states-that-dont-tax-military-retirement","states-with-internet-sales-tax",{"link":"states-without-property-tax","title":"States With No Property Tax"},"taxes-by-state"]}},"sources":[{"name":"14 States That Wonât Tax Your Pension","link":"https://www.kiplinger.com/slideshow/taxes/T054-S001-14-states-that-won-t-tax-your-pension/index.html"}],"lastModified":"2020-04-06T20:09:05.172Z","path":"states-that-dont-tax-pensions","name":"States That Dont Tax Pensions"},{"article":"The Affordable Care Act that was enacted in 2010 under former United States President Barack Obama was designed to give more Americans access to affordable healthcare. Under this expansion, households with incomes up to 133% of the federal poverty level would be eligible to receive Medicaid benefits, which provides free healthcare services. \n\nUnfortunately, this isnât universal across all of the states. As of early 2019, a total of 36 states plus Washington, D.C., have received federal funds to expand Medicaid. Additional states are expected to follow suit by the end of 2019. Some states are even working to make changes to the Medicaid program, including buy-in programs and putting lifetime caps in place. \n\nRepublican lawmakers pushed for Medicaid work requirements. This means that a person on Medicaid must be working, in school, volunteering, or participating in job training. A total of eight states have received approval from the federal government for work requirements, while other states have put in waivers or may submit them in the future. Work requirements must be approved by the government and vary by state. \n\nAs of June 2019, the states that have adopted Medicaid expansion are: \n\n- Alaska\n- Arizona\n- Arkansas\n- California\n- Colorado\n- Connecticut \n- Delaware\n- Hawaii\n- Idaho\n- Illinois\n- Indiana\n- Iowa\n- Kentucky\n- Louisiana\n- Maine\n- Maryland\n- Massachusetts \n- Michigan\n- Minnesota\n- Montana\n- Nebraska\n- Nevada\n- New Hampshire\n- New Jersey\n- New Mexico\n- New York\n- North Dakota\n- Ohio\n- Oregon\n- Pennsylvania\n- Rhode Island\n- Vermont\n- Virginia\n- Washington\n- Washington, D.C. \n- West Virginia\n\n","data":{"states":["Alaska","Arizona","Arkansas","California","Colorado","Connecticut","Delaware","Hawaii","Idaho","Illinois","Indiana","Iowa","Kentucky","Louisiana","Maine","Maryland","Massachusetts","Michigan","Minnesota","Montana","Nebraska","Nevada","New Hampshire","New Jersey","New Mexico","New York","North Dakota","Ohio","Oregon","Pennsylvania","Rhode Island","Vermont","Virginia","Washington","Washington DC","West Virginia"],"customMeta":{"relatedArticles":["federal-aid-by-state","medicaid-enrollment-by-state","medicaid-income-limits-by-state","states-that-expanded-medicaid","welfare-recipients-by-state","unemployment-benefits-by-state","unemployment-rate-by-state"]}},"sources":[{"name":"Status of State Medicaid Expansion Decisions: Interactive Map","link":"https://www.kff.org/medicaid/issue-brief/status-of-state-medicaid-expansion-decisions-interactive-map/"}],"lastModified":"2020-04-06T20:09:05.172Z","path":"states-that-expanded-medicaid","name":"States That Expanded Medicaid"},{"article":"Any adult living in the United States knows about paying taxes.

Simply installing a system in oneâs home makes it easy to utilize Earthâs hydrological cycle and allowing people to collect rainwater on their own properties reduces the demand from water facilities and improves conservation efforts.\n\nThe Federal Government does not have any laws or restrictions regarding rainwater harvesting. Most states allow citizens to collect rainwater, and even encourage them to do so. Rhode Island, Texas, and Virginia encourage residents to collect rainwater by offering a tax credit or exemption for equipment purchased for rainwater harvesting.\n\nSome states currently have restrictions on the amount of rainwater that can be collected and the method by which it is collected; however, it is not entirely illegal to collect rainwater in any of the 50 states.\n\nA reason for some of these restrictions is the belief that the harvesting would disrupt rainâs natural flow back into streams and bodies of water on the Earth. The amount of rainwater collected by individual homes, according to a study by the Scientific World Journal, would have little to no effect on the hydrological cycle, especially because homeowners would use this water for their yards or gardens, so it would return back to the Earth.\n\nIn Western states, restrictions exist because old water laws stated that all precipitation belonged to existing water-rights owners. These laws were known as prior appropriation, or âfirst-come, first serveâ laws for settlers in the Old West.\n\nRainwater harvesting poses a health problem, as some water may be unsafe and not suitable for potable purposes (i.e. drinking). This is something legislators must take into consideration.\n\nBelow is a list of rainwater harvesting laws for each state.\n\n## Alabama\n\nRainwater harvesting is considered a private property right.

For many years, states argued that they were losing money by not being able to collect sales tax on Internet sales. On June 21, 2018, the US Supreme Court changed the rules for collection of sales tax by Internet-based retailers stating that individual states can require online sellers to collect state sales tax.\r\n\r\nAny individual who sells products online should be aware of the different laws in different states. The provisions set by the states are called âRemote Seller Nexusâ and vary between states. There are four different types of Nexus according to the [Sales Tax Institute](https://www.salestaxinstitute.com/resources/remote-seller-nexus-chart):\r\n\r\n-\tClick-Through Nexus requires that if a seller contracts with an individual or company in-state who refers potential customers to the retailer for a commission, the retailer is considered to have a place of business in that state.\r\n-\tAffiliate Nexus states an affiliated person of the retailer with a physical presence, or employees or agents in-state, has sufficient nexus in state to require the retailer to collect and remit sales and use taxable retail sales of tangible personal property or services.\r\n-\tMarketplace Nexus requires the marketplace facilitator to register and collect tax as a retailer if the online marketplace operates in a state and provides e-commerce infrastructure including customer service, payment processing services and marketing. \r\n-\tEconomic Nexus requires an out-of-state retailer to collect sales tax once the retailer meets a certain level of sales transactions or gross receipts activity within the state. The retailer does not need to have a physical presence in that state.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, there are Notice and Reporting Requirements, which require retailers to notify buyers that they must pay and report state use tax on purchases. \r\n\r\nThe following states do not have an Internet sales tax:\r\n\r\n-\tAlaska\r\n-\tDelaware\r\n-\tNew Hampshire\r\n-\tMontana\r\n-\tOregon\r\n\r\nBelow are each stateâs enacted Internet sales tax provisions.

Internet Sales Tax"},{"article":"Letâs face it: everyday life can be expensive. Weâre not talking about taking extravagant trips, purchasing your childrenâs Christmas gifts, or even facing an emergency like a broken down car. Weâre talking about everyday life.\n\nThe cost of living takes into account several necessary expenses that most of us need to live from day to day. The cost of living includes housing, food, childcare, and educational costs, transportation costs, and medical costs.\n\nDepending on where you live in the world, your cost of living varies. Even within the United States, the cost of living varies from state to state. Living in New York City, for example, is far more expensive than living in a rural town in Nebraska. The price of a 3,000-square-feet home with an inground swimming pool in a small town may be the same price as a studio apartment in a big city. This example shows the differences in the cost of living.\n\nDetermining the states with the lowest cost of living can be difficult. This is because many different factors could be used. For example, one list may include childcare costs, while another leaves this off completely. However, there are a few reputable publications and organizations that have compiled data to find the states with the lowest cost of living.\n\n## Ten States with the Lowest Cost of Living\n\n#### 1. Mississippi\n\nMississippi has the lowest cost out of living of all 50 states. Mississippiâs cost of living index is 86.1. Mississippi has the lowest housing costs in the country, with the average home price at $128,000 ad the average rent for a two-bedroom apartment at $746 per month. With the lowest cost of living in the country comes the lowest median household income of $43,567 per year. \n\n#### 2. Arkansas\n\nThe state with the second-lowest cost of living is Arkansas. Arkansas has a cost of living index of 86.9, with housing, transportation, and healthcare costs all being significantly lower than the national average. To live comfortably in Arkansas, one would need to make only $44,571 for a family, which is just below the median household income of $45,726. \n\n#### 3. Oklahoma\n\nOklahoma has the third-lowest cost of living in the United States. Oklahomaâs housing costs are also very low, with the average two-bedroom apartment costing $879 per month and the median home value equaling $130,001. Oklahoma also has low transportation costs, with regular gasoline costing $2.262 per gallon as of January 2020, the second-lowest in the country. The living wage in Oklahoma is $46,159 and the median household income is $51,424. \n\n#### 4. Missouri\n\nMissouri has the fourth-lowest overall cost of living. Missouriâs housing index is only 70.6, with the second-lowest average rent in the country for a two-bedroom apartment of $827 per month. Missouri has the lowest gas prices of any state, with regular gasoline costing $2.209 per gallon as of January 2020. The livable wage in Missouri for a family of four is $53,078, which would just be covered by the stateâs median household income of $53,560. \n\n#### 5. New Mexico \n\nNew Mexico has the fifth-lowest cost of living in the United States with a cost of living index of 87.5. New Mexicoâs low cost of living is greatly influenced by its low housing costs, with a median home value of $193,200 and the average rent for a two-bedroom apartment costs $847 per month. A monthly utility bill is also below-average in New Mexico. New Mexicoâs median household income is $48,059.\n\n#### 6. Tennessee\n\nTennessee has the sixth-lowest cost of living in the United States. Tennessee has a livable wage of $46,785. Tennesseeâs housing index is 72.5, the fifth-lowest in the country. One can expect to pay about $854 per month on average for a two-bedroom apartment with some upward variation in cities such as Chattanooga and Knoxville. Monthly utility bills and healthcare costs come out to right around the national average. The median annual income in Tennessee is $50,972.\n\n#### 7. Michigan\n\nThe state with the seventh-lowest cost of living is Michigan, with an index of 89.6. The median home price in Michigan is $151,400 and the average rent for a two-bedroom apartment is $885 per month. While housing is very affordable and 70% of residents own a home, Michigan has the ninth-highest property tax rate of 1.71%. Utilities and healthcare costs are slightly below the U.S. average and grocery costs are about the same as the U.S. average. The livable wage in Michigan is $48,882 and the median household income is $54,938. \n\n#### 8. Kansas \n\nKansas has the eighth-lowest cost of living in the U.S. Kansas is tied with Tennessee for housing costs with an index of 72.5. The median home cost in Kansas is about $137,700 and the average rent for a two-bedroom apartment is $821 per month. Kansas has relatively low transportation costs, with regular gasoline costing $2.278 per gallon as of January 2020, the third-lowest price in the U.S. The livable wage in Kansas is $48,054 and the median household income is $57,422.\n\n#### 9. Georgia\n\nGeorgia ranks ninth for the lowest cost of living in the U.S. Georgiaâs housing index is 72.2, with the median home price at $186,500 and the average rent for a two-bedroom apartment at $958. Rent increases significantly in cities such as Atlanta, Savannah, Augustus, and Columbus. While transportation and grocery costs are slightly below average, Georgia residents pay a slightly above average utility bill of about $126.38 on average. The livable wage in Georgia is $47,946 and the median household income is $55,679.\n\n#### 10. Alabama\n\nAlabama finishes the top ten states with the lowest cost of living. Alabamaâs housing index is only 69.9. The median home price in Alabama is $129,300 and the average rent for a two-bedroom apartment is $772 per month. Alabama is one of the best states for retirement because it offers beaches, golf, and warm weather but is significantly cheaper than Florida. The livable wage in Alabama is $45,824 and the median household income is $48,486.

Of Living"},{"article":"Weâve all heard the adage, âNothing is certain except death and taxes.â We all know that we have to pay taxes if we live in the United States, but did you know that some states have lower tax rates than others? Some states also may eliminate certain taxes, but often, theyâre merely paying more in other types of taxes.\n\nAdult citizens in the United States pay a variety of different taxes. We pay taxes to the federal government. We also pay local and state taxes. It isnât just your annual state tax return, either. We pay property taxes, sales taxes, and other taxes that help fund things like schools, roads, and critical infrastructure.\n\nBecause there are so many different types of taxes, there isnât just one list of states with the lowest tax rates. For example, property tax in one state may be much lower but personal income tax may be much higher. But we can break down the states with the lowest taxes based on tax type.\n\n In 2018, it was found that Louisiana had the lowest property tax rate at 0.18%. Hawaii came in second with a property tax rate of 0.26%. Alabama has the third-lowest property taxes at 0.33%.\n\nThe top 10 states with the lowest property tax rates in 2018 were:\n\n- Louisiana\n- Hawaii\n- Alabama\n- Delaware\n- District of Columbia\n- West Virginia\n- South Carolina\n- Arkansas\n- Mississippi\n- New Mexico\n\nWhen it comes to states with the lowest personal income tax rates, there are several that top the list because they have no personal income tax. Those states are:\n\n- Alaska\n- Florida\n- Nevada\n- South Dakota\n- Texas\n- Washington\n- Wyoming\n- Tennessee and New Hampshire also do not charge taxes on income from wages. However, interest and dividend income are taxed.\n\nWhen it comes to sales tax, five states do not have charge sales tax. Those states are:\n\n- Alaska\n- Delaware\n- Montana\n- New Hampshire\n- Oregon\n\nItâs important to note that local municipalities in Montana and Alaska can impose a sales tax.\n\nThe organization Tax Foundation released a report in 2018 that evaluated local taxes to determine which states were the most tax-friendly. This report showed that the states with the lowest taxes were:\n\n- Alaska\n- South Dakota\n- Wyoming\n- Tennessee\n- Texas\n- Louisiana\n- New Hampshire\n- Nevada\n- South Carolina\n- Mississippi\n","data":{"states":[],"customMeta":{"note":"* Rank based on normalized and combined rates for single filers with no dependents or deductions.

There are many people for the legalization of medical marijuana, pointing to its health benefits, its natural properties, and how it can replace dangerous prescription medications. On the other side, there are opponents to legalizing medical marijuana, with most people stating that itâs an addictive drug that can lead to other, harder drugs.\n\nNo matter what your personal feelings are on the subject, some states are moving forward with the legalization of medical marijuana. In these states, medical-grade marijuana can be prescribed by a doctor to patients experiencing anything from seizures to nerve pain, glaucoma, or even cancer.\n\nWhatâs interesting about medical marijuana is how it can be administered. While most people immediately think of smoking marijuana, this isnât the only way it can be administered. There are capsules, patches, sprays, oils, and lozenges available to help a patient with their symptoms.\n\nAs of January 2019, a total of 33 states plus Washington, D.C., have legalized medical marijuana. The states where medical marijuana is legal are:\n\n- Alaska\n- Arizona\n- Arkansas\n- California\n- Colorado\n- Connecticut\n- Delaware\n- Florida\n- Hawaii\n- Illinois\n- Louisiana\n- Maine\n-

Pennsylvania\n- Rhode Island\n- Utah\n- Vermont\n- Washington\n- West Virginia\n\nIn addition to being legal in these states in the U.S., medical marijuana has also been legalized around the world in 13 countries including Australia, Poland, Germany, Israel, Italy, and Greece.\n","data":{"states":["Alaska","Arizona","Arkansas","California","Colorado","Connecticut","Delaware","Florida","Hawaii","Illinois","Louisiana","Maine","Maryland","Massachusetts","Michigan","Minnesota","Missouri","Montana","Nevada","New

health care, and other programs.\n\nHow is this money raised? It is typically raised through taxes. Most states tax the wages of its residents with a state income tax. However, some states do not have a state income tax, although residents do have to pay federal taxes.\n\nWhile living in a state with no taxes sounds great, itâs important to note that these states still have to raise revenue. This means that taxes in other areas â such as sales tax or property tax â are much higher for residents.\n\nIn the United States, there are currently seven states that do not have a state income tax. These states are:\n\n1. Alaska\n2. Florida\n3. Nevada\n4. South Dakota\n5. Texas\n6. Washington\n7. Wyoming\n\nSome states, such as Washington, have never had a personal income tax. Other states, such as Alaska, have repealed laws in recent years that require citizens to pay state income taxes.\n\nIn some states, other types of taxes are used to replace the individual income tax. In Florida, for example, residents have to pay sales taxes, higher property taxes, and corporate income taxes.\n\nThese arenât the only states that donât tax wages. Both Tennessee and New Hampshire do not have a personal income tax. However, these states do tax some dividends and interest. In Tennessee, the income tax rate on investment income is being reduced until the year 2022, when it will be eliminated. In the state of New Hampshire, there are not only no income taxes or sales taxes, but there are excise taxes. The state also has one of the highest property tax rates in the nations.\n\nWhile it seems great to live in a state where there are no personal income taxes, remember that all states have to generate their own revenue. Even if you arenât paying personal income taxes to the state, you may be spending just as much as other states through higher sales and property taxes, taxes on gas or groceries, or through different types of taxes.\n","data":{"states":["Alaska","Florida","Nevada","South Dakota","Texas","Washington","Wyoming"],"customMeta":{"note":"* States with brackets show the highest tax

violence in the United States has been a controversial topic, particularly in recent years. Some citizens and politicians push for gun control, while others believe that the countryâs laws surrounding guns should remain the same. One law that is particularly controversial is the âstand your groundâ law. \n\nStand your ground laws allow a person to use force if necessary if there is a threat of harm. Many self-defense laws state that a person that believes they are being threatened with personal injury has a duty to retreat. If there is a continued threat after leaving, the threatened person is permitted to use force to defend themselves. In stand your ground states, there is no duty to retreat. \n\nFor example, a robber comes into the home of a person who is sleeping. The person awakens and investigates the noises and is met by the robber, who is holding a gun. In states with stand your ground laws, the threatened person could respond with force â including using their own gun, if one is owned â if necessary. A person that defends themselves in such a situation would not have to worry about criminal prosecution. \n\nOpponents of stand your ground laws often believe that such laws can be dangerous. For example, a person could shoot first when there isnât a real threat. One such instance was the case against George Zimmerman, who faced criminal charges following the shooting death of Trayvon Martin. Zimmerman was later acquitted of the charges. \n\nThere are several states that have adopted stand your ground laws. Those states are: \n\n- Alabama\n- Alaska\n- Arizona\n- Florida\n- Georgia\n- Idaho\n- Indiana\n- Iowa\n- Kansas\n- Kentucky\n- Louisiana\n- Michigan\n- Mississippi\n- Missouri\n- Montana\n- Nevada\n- New Hampshire\n- North Carolina\n- Oklahoma\n- Pennsylvania\n- South Carolina\n- South Dakota\n- Tennessee\n- Texas\n- Utah\n- West Virginia\n- Wyoming\n\nSome states use stand your ground in practice, such as through jury instructions or case law. These states are: \n\nCalifornia\nColorado\nIllinois\nNew Mexico\nOregon\nVirginia\nWashington\n\nSome states have also adopted stand your ground laws, but these laws only apply when a person is in their vehicle. These states are: \n\nNorth Dakota\nOhio\nWisconsin\n\nFinally, there are states with castle doctrine, which allows a person to defend themselves using force while in the home or their vehicles, but have a duty to retreat in public places. These states are: \n\nArkansas\nConnecticut\nDelaware\nMaine\nMaryland\nMassachusetts\nMinnesota\nNebraska\nNew York\nNew Jersey\nRhode Island\n\n","data":{"states":["Alabama","Alaska","Arizona","Florida","Georgia","Idaho","Indiana","Iowa","Kansas","Kentucky","Louisiana","Michigan","Mississippi","Missouri","Montana","Nevada","New Hampshire","North Carolina","Oklahoma","Pennsylvania","South Carolina","South Dakota","Tennessee","Texas","Utah","West Virginia","Wyoming"],"customMeta":{"relatedArticles":["abortion-laws-by-state","blue-laws-by-state","child-discipline-laws-by-state","clothing-laws-by-state","common-law-marriage-states","filial-responsibility-laws-by-state","final-paycheck-laws-by-state","gun-laws-by-state","helmet-law-states","homeschool-laws-by-state","incest-laws-by-state","late-fee-laws-by-state","magazine-capacity-laws-by-state","marijuana-laws-by-state","mushroom-laws-by-state","pepper-spray-laws-by-state","seat-belt-laws-by-state","states-with-stand-your-ground-laws","tiny-house-laws-by-state","voter-id-laws-by-state"]}},"sources":[{"name":"Self Defense and âStand Your Ground","link":"http://www.ncsl.org/research/civil-and-criminal-justice/self-defense-and-stand-your-ground.aspx"}],"lastModified":"2020-04-06T20:09:05.176Z","path":"states-with-stand-your-ground-laws","name":"States With Stand Your Ground Laws"},{"article":"Climate preferences are highly personal. Some people prefer cold weather, some prefer hot, and some like it right in the middle. Some people prefer to have all four seasons â fall, winter, spring and summer â and all of the weather that comes with each. Other people would love for it to be summer all year round.\r\n\r\nIf someone is looking to move to a new state, for a vacation spot, or for a location to retire, itâs helpful to know which states in the US have the best weather year-round.\r\n\r\nThis type of information can be especially helpful for individuals who suffer from Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD). SAD is a type of depression that is affected by the seasons, typically starting in the fall and lasting through the winter, and then going away during the spring and summer. Those looking to relocate who are affected by SAD will most likely want to find a home where the weather is favorable and warm all year.\r\n\r\nWhat states have the best weather? When evaluating each state for temperature, rain, and sun, some states stand out. Although climate and weather preferences are personal and subjective, some criteria are considered to make up the best weather, according to [Current Results](https://www.currentresults.com/Weather/top-10-us-states-with-best-weather.php):\r\n\r\n-\tComfortable temperatures from 63Â°F to 86Â°F for more than half of the year.\r\n-\tDry weather with no more than 60 inches of rain per year.\r\n-\tMostly clear skies with an average of sunshine for at least 60% of the year.\r\n\r\nBased on these criteria, California has the best weather of all 50 states. Coastal cities in south and central California, such as San Diego, Los Angeles, Long Beach, and Santa Barbara, experience only 20 inches of rain per year and temperatures typically between the low 60s and 85 degrees. Los Angeles reports sunshine for 73% of the year. \r\n\r\nThe ten states in the US with the best weather are:\r\n\r\n1.\tCalifornia\r\n2.\tHawaii\r\n3.\tTexas\r\n4.\tArizona\r\n5.\tFlorida\r\n6.\tGeorgia\r\n7.\tSouth Carolina\r\n8.\tDelaware\r\n9.\tNorth Carolina\r\n10.\tLouisiana\r\n","data":{"customMeta":{"relatedArticles":["best-states-for-education","best-states-for-gun-owners","best-states-for-teachers","best-states-to-live-in","best-states-to-raise-a-family","best-states-to-retire","states-with-the-best-weather","worst-drivers-by-state","worst-states-to-live-in","worst-states-to-retire"]}},"sources":[{"name":"The 20 Best Places to Live in the U.S. for the Weather in 2019","link":"https://realestate.usnews.com/real-estate/slideshows/the-best-places-to-live-in-the-us-for-the-weather"}],"lastModified":"2020-04-06T20:09:05.176Z","path":"states-with-the-best-weather","name":"States With The Best Weather"},{"article":"âSpring Forward, Fall Back.â If youâve ever heard this saying, then you probably live in an area that observes daylight savings time. During daylight savings time in the United States, residents set their clocks ahead by one hour. This results in mornings with less sunlight and more sunlight during the evenings. \n \nDaylight savings time begins on the second Sunday in March. When it ends on the first Sunday in November, clocks are set back an hour. Clocks are always set forward or backward at 2:00 AM local time. \n \nMost states in the United States observe daylight savings time, although many people have argued against its usefulness and advocate for a year-round daylight savings time without having to set clocks forward or back. As of mid-2019, however, no changes have been made, and the majority of the U.S. states continue to observe daylight savings time. Uniform daylight savings time was established under the Uniform Time Act of 1966. \n \nThere are, however, a handful of exceptions. In Arizona, daylight savings time was observed in 1967. However, an exemption statute was enacted the following year, and ever since 1968, this state has not observed daylight savings time. However, the Navajo Indian Reservation, which is located in the states of Arizona, Utah, and New Mexico, does observe daylight savings time. \n \nThe state of Hawaii opted out of daylight savings time under the Uniform Time Act, so this state has never observed daylight savings time. Due to Hawaiiâs location, there are fewer variations between winter and summer daylight hours, so it makes sense to not have daylight savings time in this state. \n \nHawaii and Arizona are the only two states in the U.S. that do not observe daylight savings time. However, there are several overseas territories that do not observe daylight savings time. Those territories include American Samoa, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.\n\n","data":{"states":["Arizona","Hawaii"]},"sources":[{"name":"The Reason Some States Don't Observe Daylight Saving Time","link":"https://time.com/5005600/states-without-daylight-savings-time/"}],"lastModified":"2020-04-06T20:09:05.176Z","path":"states-without-daylight-savings","name":"States Without Daylight Savings"},{"article":"Residents of the United States are familiar with paying taxes. Individuals pay federal income taxes and additional state income taxes that vary depending on their state of residence. In addition to income taxes, property taxes may also be applicable. \n\nProperty tax is a real estate ad-valorem tax, considered a regressive tax, levied by the jurisdiction in which the property is located and paid for by the property owner. Taxes are determined by multiplying the property tax rate by the current market value and are recalculated annually. Property taxes are used to fund education, infrastructure, law enforcement, parks and recreation, public transportation, and water and sewer improvements. \n\nUnfortunately, every state has property taxes; however, some property taxes are very low and others do not apply to vehicles. States that have lower property taxes may have higher costs elsewhere, such as a high sales tax, in order to make up for the costs. \n\n## States with the Highest Property Tax Rates\n\nSome of the highest property taxes can generally be found in the northeast, with the highest rate being 2.44% in New Jersey. The average homeowner in New Jersey paid $8,500 per home in property taxes. One reason for the property tax rate being consistently high in New Jersey is that county and municipal governments cannot impose local income or sales tax in New Jersey as they can in other states. Property taxes pay for most of everything in New Jersey.\n\nThe second-highest property tax rate is in Illinois. The property tax rate is 2.31% in Illinois. In 1996, Illinois property tax bills were around the national average and then saw an 80% increase in the following 20 years. Home value appreciation has been lagging despite property taxes increasing quickly.\n\nNew Hampshire has the third-highest property tax rate in the U.S. of 2.20%. Residents of New Hampshire pay a higher percentage of income in property taxes (5.6%) than any other state. The high property tax rate has made it hard for younger people to purchase homes because the property tax bill is often larger than their mortgages. New Hampshire, however, does not impose an income tax on earned salaries or wages and does not have a sales tax. \n\nThe fourth-highest property tax rate is in Connecticut, which has a rate of 2.07%.  The state per capita tax burden is at $2,847, twice the national average of $1,518. Property taxes now total over $11 billion annually in Connecticut. Local officials are worried that relying on property tax to fund the local government is unsustainable. \n\nWisconsin has the fifth-highest property tax rate in the United States of 1.94%, which finally dips just below 2%. Per capita property taxes in Wisconsin are about $1,615.71, above the national average. The median home value in Wisconsin in $178,900 and the median household income is $59,305.\n\n## States with the Lowest Property Tax Rates\n\nAs previously stated, there are no states that have no real estate property tax. There are 26 states, however, that have property taxes below 1.00%.\n\nWhich state has the lowest property tax rate? Hawaii has the lowest property tax rate of 0.27%. Although this rate is very low, Hawaii has a very high median house cost; therefore, homeowners will still expect to pay around $1,529 in property taxes.\n\nAlabama has not only the second-lowest property tax rate of 0.42% but also has one of the lowest median home prices ($130,500) well below the median home value in the United States ($225,300). This makes the median annual tax only $558. \n\nLouisiana has the third-lowest property tax rate in the U.S. of 0.52%. Louisianaâs property tax rate is less than half that of the national average of 1.08%. One reason that property taxes are so low is the stateâs homestead exemption, which reduces the taxable value of owner-occupied properties by $7,500 in assessed value. \n\nColorado has the fourth-lowest property tax rate of 0.55%. With the average home value being the fifth-highest in the nation, homeowners can expect to pay the 21st lowest average property tax bill in the country instead of the fourth-lowest. \n\nDelaware has the fifth-lowest property tax rate in the U.S. of 0.56%. Delawareâs high income tax rate is offset by its low property tax rate and lack of retail sales tax. The low property taxes are attractive to residents, especially retirees, of other states, especially the stateâs neighbor, New Jersey, which has the highest property tax rate in the country.\n\n\n\n\n","frontmatter":{"title":"States With No Property

To simplify, when you make a purchase, the sales tax is added to the cost of your purchase. For example, if a state has a 5% sales tax and you purchase an item that costs ten dollars, you will pay $10.50 at the register.\n\nThe amount of sales tax varies from state to state. Some states â 38 as of November 2018 â also have local sales taxes. The highest average combined state and local tax rates are in Tennessee, Louisiana, Arkansas, and Washington, each of which has combined taxes of over 9%. At the state level, California has the highest tax rate at 7.25%. Four states fall only slightly behind with state sales tax rates of 7%.

All consumer debts have limits on the number of years creditors have, and each state has its own limitations. \n\nDebts that have passed the statute of limitations are known as time-barred debt. Even after the statute of limitations passes, these debts still appear on credit reports and your credit rating is still affected. Furthermore, having time-barred debts does not mean you are no longer responsible for paying the debt back. \n\nEvery state has its own statute of limitations on debt, and each varies depending on the type of debt you have. There are four types of debt. An oral agreement is a debt made based on a verbal agreement to pay back the money. A written contract is a debt that came with a contract signed by you and the creditor. A promissory note is a written agreement to pay back the debt in payment at a specific interest rate by a certain date and time. An open-ended account is an account with a revolving balance that you can repay and then borrow again such as a credit card.\n\nIt is important that you establish which type of debt you have when

States has its laws surrounding crime. Whether it is whether or not marijuana is legal or the maximum penalties for committing a particular crime, state laws vary. In some states, local governments have enacted âstop and identifyâ statutes.\n\nWhat does âstop and identifyâ mean? Itâs a simple concept. In states where this statute is enacted, a person suspected of committing a crime is legally obligated to identify themselves to authorities. However, even in states where this statute is in place, a person is not required to provide identification to the police unless there is a reasonable belief that:\n\n- A crime has been committed\n- A crime is currently being committed\n- A crime was committed\n\nIf any of the above conditions are met, a police officer may also temporarily detain the suspect and can conduct a patdown if it is believed that the suspect is carrying a weapon. Unreasonable searches and seizures, however, are banned, and a warrant must be issued after showing probable cause to conduct searches of vehicles, homes, or other property.\n\nAny states that are not on this list are not required to show their ID to police officers.\n\nEven though all of these states have some form of âstop and identifyâ laws, these laws vary by state. For example, in some states, name, address, and what a person is doing is all that needs to be disclosed. In other states, such as Indiana, date of birth is required. According to the laws of Nevada, all that is required to be disclosed is a personâs full name. In seven of these states, there is a criminal penalty imposed for anyone that does not comply with identifying themselves under âstop and identifyâ laws.\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Stop and Identify States"},"data":{"states":["Alabama","Arizona","Arkansas","Colorado","Delaware","Florida","Georgia","Illinois","Indiana","Kansas","Louisiana","Missouri","Montana","Nebraska","Nevada","New Hampshire","New Mexico","North Dakota","Ohio","Rhode Island","Utah","Vermont","Wisconsin"],"customMeta":{"relatedArticles":["sanctuary-states",{"link":"stop-and-id-states","title":"Stop and Identify States"},"cost-of-illegal-immigration-by-state"]}},"sources":[{"name":"Do I Have to Show the Police My ID?","link":"https://www.thoughtco.com/show-the-police-my-id-970889"},{"name":"ACLU of New York","link":"https://www.nyclu.org/en/know-your-rights/what-do-if-youre-stopped-police"}],"lastModified":"2020-04-06T20:09:05.176Z","path":"stop-and-id-states","name":"Stop And Id States"},{"article":"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC for short, compiled [extensive data](https://www.usatoday.com/list/news/depression-suicide-by-state/346e182d-d439-4448-b8d9-a0233a45f598/) on the suicide rates of each state in the US. The University of Washington also put together their findings on the rates of depression in people nationwide, and after categorizing the responses by state, the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation reported the depression rates of each state in the USA for every 100,000 people. \n\nWe will show you individual lists that display the [suicide rates](https://afsp.org/about-suicide/suicide-statistics/), the number of deaths by suicide, and the depression rates of people in each US state in 2017. Even those these data points date back to 2016 and 2017, these findings are the most solid and all-encompassing results of any accessible data collected over the years. \n\nSuicide is a serious issue, to state the obvious. But something to take into consideration regarding suicide rates in the United States of America is that many suicides are the result of circumstances that were beyond avoidable. One thing that is a heavy commonality among people who die by suicide is an unshakeable feeling of dread, despair, loneliness, and hopelessness. These adjectives can be said to be overused in the discussions revolving around suicide, but they need to be taken seriously in order for suicide rates by state to decrease.\n\nAs you can tell by viewing the University of Washingtonâs collective data on the depression rates nationwide, people in 2017 were reportedly very unhappy with life in general. While situations outside of an individualâs control play a huge role in someoneâs mental well-being, other innate factors such as disorders of the mind and abnormalities at birth can heighten someoneâs propensity for experiencing depression, whether as the occasional episode or a lifelong ailment. \n\nIn order to lower the rates of deaths that occur as a result of suicide, the country needs to address many common underlying factors that add up and make someone more likely to choose suicide as an outlet. Depression rates are one factor that hold serious importance, but other factors to take into consideration areâ¦\n\n- Academic performance\n- Physical condition\n- Mental health and well-being\n- Economical standing\n- Financial struggles\n- Workplace performance\n- Overall life satisfaction\n\nThe list truly goes on and on, but one factor that holds true is that the United States could be working more intuitively and intentionally to decrease the suicide rates by state in the nation. The suicide rates in the United States are not always the most reliable because many suicides go undetected. Even so, it is possible to identify which states have more at-risk factors and then deduce which states are more likely to bear witness to their residents passing away by suicide. \n","data":{"states":[],"customMeta":{"note":"* Rates are per 100,000 people","columns":["state",{"header":"Suicide Rate","field":"suicideRate"},{"header":"Total Suicides Number","field":"suicideNumber"}],"showAllStates":true,"sortAsc":false,"sortField":"suicideRate","tileMap":{"field":"suicideRate"},"scatterChartFields":[{"field":"suicideRate","title":"Suicide Rate","label":"Suicides per 100,000 people"},{"field":"suicideNumber","title":"Total Suicides","label":"Total # of Suicides"}],"relatedArticles":["abortion-rates-by-state","corporate-tax-rates-by-state","crime-rate-by-state","depression-rates-by-state","employment-rate-by-state","infant-mortality-rate-by-state","labor-force-participation-rate-by-state","murder-rate-by-state","obesity-rate-by-state","smoking-rates-by-state","unemployment-rate-by-state"]},"customData":[{"suicideRate":16.6,"state":"Alabama","suicideNumber":836},{"suicideRate":27,"state":"Alaska","suicideNumber":200},{"suicideRate":18.2,"state":"Arizona","suicideNumber":1327},{"suicideRate":20.8,"state":"Arkansas","suicideNumber":631},{"suicideRate":10.5,"state":"California","suicideNumber":4312},{"suicideRate":20.3,"state":"Colorado","suicideNumber":1181},{"suicideRate":10.5,"state":"Connecticut","suicideNumber":405},{"suicideRate":11.6,"state":"Delaware","suicideNumber":112},{"suicideRate":14,"state":"Florida","suicideNumber":3227},{"suicideRate":13.6,"state":"Georgia","suicideNumber":1451},{"suicideRate":15.2,"state":"Hawaii","suicideNumber":227},{"suicideRate":23.2,"state":"Idaho","suicideNumber":392},{"suicideRate":11.2,"state":"Illinois","suicideNumber":1474},{"suicideRate":16.3,"state":"Indiana","suicideNumber":1092},{"suicideRate":15,"state":"Iowa","suicideNumber":479},{"suicideRate":19.1,"state":"Kansas","suicideNumber":553},{"suicideRate":16.9,"state":"Kentucky","suicideNumber":770},{"suicideRate":15.2,"state":"Louisiana","suicideNumber":720},{"suicideRate":18.9,"state":"Maine","suicideNumber":274},{"suicideRate":9.8,"state":"Maryland","suicideNumber":630},{"suicideRate":9.5,"state":"Massachusetts","suicideNumber":682},{"suicideRate":14.1,"state":"Michigan","suicideNumber":1457},{"suicideRate":13.8,"state":"Minnesota","suicideNumber":783},{"suicideRate":15,"state":"Mississippi","suicideNumber":445},{"suicideRate":18.5,"state":"Missouri","suicideNumber":1151},{"suicideRate":28.9,"state":"Montana","suicideNumber":311},{"suicideRate":14.7,"state":"Nebraska","suicideNumber":275},{"suicideRate":20.3,"state":"Nevada","suicideNumber":627},{"suicideRate":18.9,"state":"New Hampshire","suicideNumber":265},{"suicideRate":8.3,"state":"New Jersey","suicideNumber":795},{"suicideRate":23.3,"state":"New Mexico","suicideNumber":491},{"suicideRate":8.1,"state":"New York","suicideNumber":1696},{"suicideRate":14.3,"state":"North Carolina","suicideNumber":1521},{"suicideRate":20.1,"state":"North Dakota","suicideNumber":154},{"suicideRate":14.8,"state":"Ohio","suicideNumber":1740},{"suicideRate":19.1,"state":"Oklahoma","suicideNumber":756},{"suicideRate":19,"state":"Oregon","suicideNumber":825},{"suicideRate":15,"state":"Pennsylvania","suicideNumber":2030},{"suicideRate":11.8,"state":"Rhode Island","suicideNumber":129},{"suicideRate":16.3,"state":"South Carolina","suicideNumber":838},{"suicideRate":22.5,"state":"South Dakota","suicideNumber":191},{"suicideRate":16.8,"state":"Tennessee","suicideNumber":1166},{"suicideRate":13.4,"state":"Texas","suicideNumber":3778},{"suicideRate":22.7,"state":"Utah","suicideNumber":663},{"suicideRate":18.3,"state":"Vermont","suicideNumber":112},{"suicideRate":13.4,"state":"Virginia","suicideNumber":1179},{"suicideRate":16.9,"state":"Washington","suicideNumber":1297},{"suicideRate":21.1,"state":"West Virginia","suicideNumber":393},{"suicideRate":15.4,"state":"Wisconsin","suicideNumber":926},{"suicideRate":26.9,"state":"Wyoming","suicideNumber":157}]},"sources":[{"name":"Suicide Statistics","link":"https://afsp.org/about-suicide/suicide-statistics/"}],"lastModified":"2020-04-06T20:09:05.176Z","path":"suicide-rates-by-state","name":"Suicide Rates By State"},{"article":"In the United States, a president is elected every four years.

Not only do you have to pay federal taxes, but you also have to pay taxes to your state. While it can be a burden, these tax dollars are critical to the stateâs revenue, which is used to build and repair critical infrastructure, fund state programs, and for other important purposes. \n\nNot only do state taxes cut into your household income, but understanding how much you have to pay can be confusing. Each state has its own rules surrounding different types of taxes and each taxpayerâs circumstances (i.e., is the taxpayer married or does the taxpayer have dependents?) To make it easier to understand how much a person has to pay in each state, we can look at a ratio known as the tax burden. \n\nThe tax burden is a measure of all of the total income that residents of a state pay in state and local taxes. For this article, weâre going to take a look at the states that have the highest and lowest tax burdens based on data compiled by WalletHub. Each tax burden listed here takes into account property taxes, income taxes, and sales and excise taxes. \n\nThe state with the highest tax burden based on these three types of taxes is New York. The total tax burden of New York is 12.97%. Hawaii isnât too far behind with a total tax burden of 11.71%. Maine comes in third place with a tax burden of 10.84%. \n\nOther states with a total tax burden higher than 10% are Vermont, Minnesota, and Rhode Island.\n\nThe state with the lowest tax burden is Alaska at 5.1%. Delawareâs total tax burden isnât much higher at 5.55%. The state of Tennessee has the third lowest tax burden at 6.28%. \n\nWhen breaking down tax burdens by category, New Hampshire has the highest property tax burden in the nation at 5.45%. Vermont and New Jersey also have property tax burdens that exceed 5%.\n\nThe lowest property tax burden is in Alabama, where the rate is 1.39%. Oklahoma, Arkansas, Delaware, Tennessee, Kentucky, and New Mexico also have property taxes that fall below 2%. \n\nWhen it comes to the individual income tax burden, New York has the highest at 4.81%. Oregon also has an income tax burden that exceeds 4%. Several states have no income taxes. These states are Nevada, Washington, Florida, South Dakota, Alaska, Texas, and Wyoming.\n\nWhen looking at the sales and excise tax burden, Hawaii has the highest in the nation at 6.56%. Nevada has the second highest at 6.02%. The lowest sales and excise tax burden can be found in Oregon, where the rate is 1.09%. \n","data":{"states":[],"customMeta":{"columns":[{"header":"Overall Rank","field":"overallRank"},"state",{"header":"Total Tax Burden","field":"totalTaxBurden","format":"percAlt"},{"header":"Property Tax Burden","field":"propertyTaxBurden","format":"percAlt"},{"header":"Indiv.

Taxes are used to fund a number of public expenditures, such as roads, public transportation, education, and others. When expenditures exceed tax revenue, the government goes into debt.\r\n\r\nTaxes have two effects:\r\n\r\n-\tAn income effect because they reduce purchasing power to taxpayers (income tax)\r\n-\tA substitution effect when taxes cause a substitution between taxed goods and untaxed goods (sales tax)\r\n\r\nFederal income tax is the tax levied by the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) on the earnings of individuals and legal entities. However, most states collect state income and sales taxes in addition to the federal income tax. State taxes are given little attention compared to federal income taxes.\r\n\r\nStates take one of three approaches when it comes to state income taxes:\r\n\r\n-\tThe state does not collect income tax\r\n-\tThe state imposes a flat tax, taxing all income (or only dividends and interest) at the same rate\r\n-\tThe state imposes a progressive tax which taxes higher income at higher rates\r\n\r\nFirst, there are seven states that do not collect a state income tax. While these states do not have an additional income tax, other taxes, such as property or sales taxes, could be higher in these states. The seven states are:\r\n\r\n-\tAlaska\r\n-\tFlorida\r\n-\tNevada\r\n-\tSouth Dakota\r\n-\tTexas\r\n-\tWashington\r\n-\tWyoming\r\n\r\nSecond, there are eleven states with flat income tax rates. In New Hampshire and Tennessee, the tax rate applies to dividends and interest income and regular income is typically not subject to state tax. These states are:\r\n\r\n-\tColorado (4.63%)\r\n-\tIllinois (4.95%)\r\n-\tIndiana (3.23%)\r\n-\tKentucky (5%)\r\n-\tMassachusetts (5.05%)\r\n-\tMichigan (4.25%)\r\n-\tNew Hampshire (5%)\r\n-\tNorth Carolina (5.25%)\r\n-\tPennsylvania (3.07%)\r\n-\tTennessee (2%)\r\n-\tUtah (4.95%)\r\n\r\nThe remaining states and the District of Columbia have state income tax brackets. The higher an individualâs income, the higher the tax bracket he/she will be placed into. California has the highest potential state income tax bracket of 13%.\r\n\r\nBelow is a table with each stateâs lowest and highest state income tax bracket. \r\n","data":{"customMeta":{"relatedArticles":["alcohol-tax-by-state","corporate-tax-rates-by-state","income-tax-by-state","sales-tax-by-state","states-that-dont-tax-pensions","states-with-lowest-taxes","taxes-on-lottery-winnings-by-state","capital-gains-tax-by-state","gas-taxes-by-state","property-taxes-by-state","state-tax-rates","states-that-tax-social-security","states-with-no-income-tax","tax-burden-by-state","car-sales-tax-by-state","highest-taxed-states","retirement-taxes-by-state","states-that-dont-tax-military-retirement","states-with-internet-sales-tax",{"link":"states-without-property-tax","title":"States With No Property Tax"},"taxes-by-state"]}},"lastModified":"2020-04-06T20:09:05.176Z","path":"taxes-by-state","name":"Taxes By State"},{"article":"Thereâs no doubt that winning the lottery is exciting and can significantly help the winner financially; however, the winner must not be too quick to spend all of his or her winnings. Like other income in the United States, the IRS taxes lottery winnings. \r\n\r\nLottery winnings are considered ordinary taxable income for both federal and state tax purposes. Winnings are taxed the same as wages or salaries are, and the total amount the winner receives must be reported on their tax return each year. Before the winner receives any of the money, however, the IRS automatically takes 24% of the winnings. The rest of the winnings are expected to be paid by the winner when filing the return. \r\n\r\nWhat is the tax rate for lottery winnings? For federal taxes, lottery winnings are taxed according to the [federal tax brackets](https://www.quickenloans.com/blog/federal-income-tax-brackets). Federal tax brackets are progressive, so portions of the winnings are taxed at different rates, and could be as high as 37%. State income taxes vary by location. Some states do not have a state income tax, while others may withhold up to 8.82%. \r\n\r\nThe states that do not levy an individual income tax are:\r\n\r\n-\tFlorida\r\n-\tNew Hampshire\r\n-\tTennessee\r\n-\tTexas\r\n-\tSouth Dakota\r\n-\tWashington\r\n-\tWyoming\r\n\r\nSix states do not have a lottery: Alabama, Alaska, Hawaii, Mississippi, Nevada, and Utah. Two states, California and Delaware, do have a lottery but do not tax winnings.\r\n\r\nIf the winner buys a winning ticket in a state that they do not live in, most states will not withhold the winnings.

Unfortunately, many teachers are underpaid for taking on one of the most important tasks for a new generation: educating our youth. \n\nLike any other profession, the average salaries of teachers varies from state to state. This isnât just a small difference either. In some states, salaries are thousands of dollars higher than in other states. \n\nIn this post, weâre going to look the pay for new teachers by state. As a teacher gains more experience, they can earn higher pay but we are going to focus solely on the salaries of teachers that are just getting started. \n\nThe highest pay in the nation for new teachers is in Washington, D.C. In this area, the average salary is $55,209. New Jersey isnât far behind with an average salary of $51,443. These are the only two states in the nation where new teachers can make a salary of over $50,000 annually.\n\nThe third highest salary for teachers can be found in California, where teachers make almost $47,000. In the states of Alaska and Hawaii, new teachers also earn over $46,000. \n\nNow, letâs take a look at the lowest paid teachers in the nation. Montana currently has the lowest salary for teachers at $31,418 â over $20,000 less than the average salary in Washington, D.C., and New Jersey.

Despite these lower rates, however, the U.S. continues to have the highest teen pregnancy rate of all developed nations.\n\nTeen pregnancy has substantial health, economic, and social costs. Pregnant teenagers are more likely to experience miscarriages, maternal illness (preeclampsia, hypertension, etc.), stillbirth, and neonatal death. Teenage mothers are also more likely to drop out of school and never return in order to raise a child. Teen mothers, therefore, often lack a high school diploma, let alone a college degree, and will likely face unemployment and poverty. Children of teen pregnancies are sometimes forced into foster care if the mother cannot care for them, where teenage females are twice as likely to become pregnant, creating a cycle. \n\nOne of the best ways to prevent teen pregnancies is the use of birth control methods, such as condoms or oral contraceptives, and providing easy access to such things. Comprehensive sex education in and outside of schools has been proven to be very effective, and sex education courses must be given to both boys and girls. Additionally, mentorship from peers or older teens tends to be more comfortable and impactful then from parents. Some communities have set up mentorship programs to help encourage healthy sexuality discussions among teens. \n\n[Research](https://www.livescience.com/5728-teen-birth-rates-higher-highly-religious-states.html) suggests that âU.S states whose residents have more conservative religious beliefs on average tend to have higher rates of teenagers giving birth.â Of the ten most conservatively religious states in the United States, eight are among the states that have the highest teen birth rates. \n\nTeen birth rates are measured as the number of births per 1,000 women between the ages of 15 and 19. \n\n## Ten States with the Highest Teen Pregnancy Rates\n\n#### 1. Arkansas\n\nArkansas has the highest teen birth rate of 30.4 births per 1,000 women. Arkansas is one of the most conservatively religious states in the country. Despite being the highest in the country, Arkansasâs birth rate has seen a significant decline in recent years, dropping from 59.1 in 2005, to 39.5 in 2014, and finally to 30.4 in 2018. \n\n#### 2. Mississippi\n\nMississippi has the second-highest teen birth rate of 27.8 births per 1,000 women. The Arkansas-Mississippi Delta area has the highest birth rates, [a study](https://www.mathematica.org/our-publications-and-findings/publications/accelerating-teen-pregnancy-prevention-in-phillips-county-arkansas-and-coahoma-county-mississippi) found, pointing to community norms and socioeconomic factors in the area that could compound to contribute to higher teen pregnancy rates, such as poverty, discrimination, lack of comprehensive sex education. \n\n#### 3. Oklahoma\n\nOklahomaâs teen birth rate is 27.2 births per 1,000 women, giving it the third-highest teen birth rate in the United States. In Oklahoma, 1-in-5 births to girls ages 15 through 19 is not the motherâs first child. One issue seen in the state is some of the school districts, such as the Oklahoma City Public Schools, fail to provide sex education at any grade level for its students. \n\n#### 4. Louisiana\n\nLouisianaâs birth rate of 27.5 births per 1,000 women is the fourth-highest in the country. About 75% of teen births in Louisiana are to mothers who were in their late teens, (age 18 ad 19) and 18% of teen births were to teens who already have a child. Pediatrician Scott Hamilton explained that sec education isnât a part of school systems and itâs not something discussed at home with parents. \n\n#### 5. Kentucky\n\nKentucky has the fifth-highest teen birth rate of 27.3 births per 1,000 women. Kentuckyâs urban counties have seen a larger decline in teen pregnancies than in its rural counties, likely because teens in rural areas have little access to health care, including access to contraceptives, are more likely to live in poverty, and have fewer educational opportunities. The disparity in these pregnancy rates is largely explained by the lack of healthcare and lack of education in rural areas. \n\n#### 6. West Virginia\n\nWest Virginiaâs teen birth rate is 25.4 births per 1,000 women. Some counties in West Virginia experience exceptionally high teen birth rates around 48 births per 1,000 women, likely due to being in rural areas. About 79% of West Virginiaâs teen births are to older teens (age 18-19) and about 19% of teen births are to teens who already have a child. \n\n#### 7. New Mexico\n\nNew Mexicoâs teen birth rate of 25.3 births per 1,000 women is the seventh-highest in the United States. 55.1% of female teens ages 15 to 19 in New Mexico are Hispanic and 81% of the teens that gave birth in 2017 were Hispanic. New Mexico has a child poverty rate of 25.9%, which is a large contributing factor to teen pregnancies. New Mexicoâs teen birth rate is still declining, however, and in 2015, the public savings due to the decline in the teen birth rate total $38 million. \n\n#### 8. Texas\n\nTexas is tied with New Mexico for the seventh-highest teen birth rate in the United States of 25.3. Every year, around 35,000 women in Texas get pregnant before the age of 20. It is difficult for women to access reproductive services in Texas, which contributes to not only the high teen birth rate but also contributes to the reason why Texas has the highest rate of repeat-teen births. Other factors that researchers believe are contributing to this are a lack of sex education and abstinence-only programs.  \n\n#### 9. Tennessee\n\nTied with Texas and New Mexico with a teen birth rate of 25.3 is Tennessee. Unsurprisingly, the rural counties in Tennessee showed higher teen birth rates. The Tennessee Department of Health has made reducing the teen birth rate a priority and their efforts are being seen. The Tennessee Adolescent Pregnancy Prevention Program (TAPPP) is one of the programs implemented that aims to educate and mentor young teens and adults about healthy sexual relationships. \n\n#### 10. Alabama\n\nFinishing the top ten states with the highest teen birth rates in the United States is Alabama with a teen birth rate of 25.2 births per 1,000 women. About 74% of teen births in Alabama are to older teens (ages 18-19) and 16% of teen births are to teens who already have children. Like other states with high teen birth rates, Alabama has its fair share of rural areas and is also one of the most religious states in the country. Despite this, Alabama has seen significant improvements in its teen birth rate in the past few decades, which has decreased by about 63% since 1991.  \n\n","data":{"states":["Arkansas","Mississippi","Oklahoma","Louisiana","Kentucky","New Mexico","Texas","West Virginia","Alabama","Tennessee"],"customMeta":{"note":"* Rates are per 100,000 people","columns":["state",{"header":"Teen Pregnancy Rate","field":"teenBirthRate"}],"sortField":"teenBirthRate","showAllStates":true,"tileMap":{"field":"teenBirthRate"},"scatterChartFields":[{"field":"teenBirthRate","title":"Teen Birth Rate"}],"relatedArticles":["abortion-rates-by-state","birth-rate-by-state","crime-rate-by-state","depression-rates-by-state","employment-rate-by-state","infant-mortality-rate-by-state","maternal-mortality-rate-by-state","suicide-rates-by-state"]},"customData":[{"teenBirthRate":25.2,"state":"Alabama"},{"teenBirthRate":19.3,"state":"Alaska"},{"teenBirthRate":20.1,"state":"Arizona"},{"teenBirthRate":30.4,"state":"Arkansas"},{"teenBirthRate":13.6,"state":"California"},{"teenBirthRate":14.3,"state":"Colorado"},{"teenBirthRate":8.3,"state":"Connecticut"},{"teenBirthRate":16.7,"state":"Delaware"},{"teenBirthRate":16.7,"state":"Florida"},{"teenBirthRate":20.6,"state":"Georgia"},{"teenBirthRate":17.2,"state":"Hawaii"},{"teenBirthRate":16,"state":"Idaho"},{"teenBirthRate":15.8,"state":"Illinois"},{"teenBirthRate":21.8,"state":"Indiana"},{"teenBirthRate":15.3,"state":"Iowa"},{"teenBirthRate":20,"state":"Kansas"},{"teenBirthRate":27.3,"state":"Kentucky"},{"teenBirthRate":27.5,"state":"Louisiana"},{"teenBirthRate":11.1,"state":"Maine"},{"teenBirthRate":14.1,"state":"Maryland"},{"teenBirthRate":7.2,"state":"Massachusetts"},{"teenBirthRate":15.8,"state":"Michigan"},{"teenBirthRate":10.2,"state":"Minnesota"},{"teenBirthRate":27.8,"state":"Mississippi"},{"teenBirthRate":21.6,"state":"Missouri"},{"teenBirthRate":17.2,"state":"Montana"},{"teenBirthRate":16.7,"state":"Nebraska"},{"teenBirthRate":20.5,"state":"Nevada"},{"teenBirthRate":8,"state":"New Hampshire"},{"teenBirthRate":10.3,"state":"New Jersey"},{"teenBirthRate":25.3,"state":"New Mexico"},{"teenBirthRate":11.7,"state":"New York"},{"teenBirthRate":18.7,"state":"North Carolina"},{"teenBirthRate":16.4,"state":"North Dakota"},{"teenBirthRate":18.9,"state":"Ohio"},{"teenBirthRate":27.2,"state":"Oklahoma"},{"teenBirthRate":13.3,"state":"Oregon"},{"teenBirthRate":14.1,"state":"Pennsylvania"},{"teenBirthRate":11.5,"state":"Rhode Island"},{"teenBirthRate":22,"state":"South Carolina"},{"teenBirthRate":20.4,"state":"South Dakota"},{"teenBirthRate":25.3,"state":"Tennessee"},{"teenBirthRate":25.3,"state":"Texas"},{"teenBirthRate":13.1,"state":"Utah"},{"teenBirthRate":8.8,"state":"Vermont"},{"teenBirthRate":14.3,"state":"Virginia"},{"teenBirthRate":12.7,"state":"Washington"},{"teenBirthRate":25.4,"state":"West Virginia"},{"teenBirthRate":13,"state":"Wisconsin"},{"teenBirthRate":20.8,"state":"Wyoming"}]},"sources":[{"name":"Teen Birth Rate By State","link":"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/sosmap/teen-births/teenbirths.htm"}],"lastModified":"2020-04-06T20:09:05.176Z","path":"teen-pregnancy-rates-by-state","name":"Teen Pregnancy Rates By State"},{"article":"Adding tint to car windows can prove to become beneficial in the long run. This statement is especially true for people living in areas with plenty of sunshine. However, there are laws that each state abides by to ensure that an individualâs tint isnât too dark. To provide more insight on this topic, here are the rules surrounding tint on cars. \n\n## Windows \nTypically, the tint on a personâs car is too dark if they are unable to be seen by anyone else while in the car. However, other states go into more detail regarding different parts of a vehicle, such as the:\n\n## Windshield\n- Front and backside windows\n- Rear window\n- Side mirrors\n\nThere is only one state that allows people to tint their windows to any tint percentage: Michigan. On the contrary, there are seven states and one district that only allow a lighter tint on car windows (California, Iowa, Alaska, Pennsylvania, New York, Rhode Island, Delaware, and Washington D.C.). Three other states do not allow tint on cars at all (New Jersey, Vermont, and New Hampshire).\n\nThe remaining states vary their tint laws based on a tint percentage between 10% and 60%. To see the rates in each state, check out the chart that goes into more detail about tinting.\n\n## Colors\nAs with tinted windows, the color of the tint depends on the state that a person resides in currently. Nonetheless, some states are more lenient when it comes to colored shades, and some are more strict.\n\nThe states that are more lenient on tinted colors, meaning that they will allow some colored tints, include, but are not limited to:\n\n- Montana\n- Colorado\n- Arizona\n- Florida\n\nOther states, on the other hand, are more strict with this rule and will only allow lighter colors on car tints. Some of these states wonât allow any color at all. These are some of the states that carry this law:\n\n- Michigan\n- New Hampshire\n- New Jersey\n- Washington D.C.\n\n## Exceptions\nDespite each stateâs law regarding tints, there is one main reason why someone is allowed to have tint on their windows: for medical purposes. Some of the medical conditions that entitle individuals to add tint to their cars include:\n\n- Albinism\n- Bloom Syndrome\n- Solar Urticaria\n\nAlthough having any disease that prevents people from being exposed to light is severe, many states still do not allow tint on cars for medical reasons. There are a total of 3 states that enforce this law:\n\n- Colorado\n- Hawaii\n- Utah\n\nOther states do not allow tint for medical purposes either. Still, they have a certain percentage that individuals can have their tint set to and always be within the legal limit.

While many Americans still have that dream, more people are going in the opposite direction. Instead of buying a huge, expensive home filled with lots of stuff, some people are downsizing, cleaning out their clutter, and living a simpler life in a tiny house. \n\nA tiny house is exactly what it sounds like â a house that is very tiny. Weâre not talking about a one bedroom home thatâs 1,000 square feet, either. A residential structure under 500 square feet is considered a tiny home, although there isnât a set definition so some homes may be slightly larger. \n\nThere are many different types of tiny houses. Some have wheels so they can be moved from place to place â perfect for the traveling homeowner. Others are stationary. Throughout the nation, there are tiny house communities. In other areas, some tiny house owners live completely off the grid. \n\nThe interiors of these homes are creatively designed to get the most out of such a small space. Built-in storage, no bathtubs in bathrooms, smaller kitchen appliances, and lofts that serve as bedrooms are just a few of the ways that people are comfortably living in tiny houses. \n\nBecause these are dwellings, in most areas in the U.S., building and zoning laws apply. These laws vary by state, county, and even city. Many areas do not even have tiny house laws yet since this is a relatively new idea, but laws may be implemented in the near future as popularity grows. In all states, though, the proper building permits must be acquired and builders have to follow all zoning regulations. \n\nSome states have outlined specific laws for tiny houses. The state of Michigan has seen an increase in pop-up communities with efficient dwellings that have been helpful in cities such as Detroit. Based on Michiganâs law, tiny houses can be built provided they follow codes and are not less than 500 square feet. \n\nIn the state of Nevada, most areas will issue a building permit provided the tiny house has at least 200 square feet of living space. \n\nIn some cities and towns in Colorado, there is no set minimum square footage for houses, making this a very tiny house-friendly state. \n\nTo get a building permit in the state of North Carolina, the tiny home must be at least 150 square feet. However, for every additional occupant, 100 square feet must be added. This means that a couple must build a structure of 250 square feet, while a family of four is required to build a tiny home of at least 450 square feet. \n\nLaws are similar in South Dakota. A building permit can be obtained for a dwelling of at least 190 square feet, but 50 square feet must be added for each additional occupant. \n\nIn Maine, you can build a tiny home provided that the home is less than 400 square feet and there are proper sleeping arrangements for all occupants.  \n\nWhile laws vary across the nation when it comes to tiny homes, this growing movement could push lawmakers to create more specific laws in the future. \n\n","data":{"customMeta":{"relatedArticles":["abortion-laws-by-state","blue-laws-by-state","child-discipline-laws-by-state","clothing-laws-by-state","common-law-marriage-states","filial-responsibility-laws-by-state","final-paycheck-laws-by-state","gun-laws-by-state","helmet-law-states","homeschool-laws-by-state","incest-laws-by-state","late-fee-laws-by-state","magazine-capacity-laws-by-state","marijuana-laws-by-state","mushroom-laws-by-state","pepper-spray-laws-by-state","seat-belt-laws-by-state","states-with-stand-your-ground-laws","tiny-house-laws-by-state","voter-id-laws-by-state"]}},"sources":[{"name":"Tiny House Laws in the United States","link":"https://www.tinysociety.co/articles/tiny-house-laws-united-states/"}],"lastModified":"2020-04-06T20:09:05.176Z","path":"tiny-house-laws-by-state","name":"Tiny House Laws By State"},{"article":"Tornado Alley is the name commonly use for the corridor-shaped region in the United States Midwest that sees the most tornado activity. While it is not an official designation, states most commonly included are Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska, Missouri, Iowa, and South Dakota.\n\nFlorida, while not geographically part of tornado alley, sees more tornados than any other state, especially when accounting for how large the state is. The following list, reported by theÂ National Climatic Data CenterÂ shows the seventeen U.S. states with the highest average number of tornadoes per 10,000 sq. miles each year. Figures are for the years 1991 through 2010.\n\n- Florida: 12.2\n- Kansas: 11.7\n- Maryland: 9.9\n- Illinois: 9.7\n- Mississippi: 9.2\n- Iowa: 9.1\n- Oklahoma: 9\n- South Carolina: 9\n- Alabama: 8.6\n- Louisiana: 8.5\n- Arkansas: 7.5\n- Nebraska: 7.4\n- Missouri: 6.5\n- North Carolina: 6.4\n- Tennessee: 6.2\n- Indiana: 6.1\n- Texas: 5.9\n\nThe average tornado only stays on ground for 5 minutes, and approximately 77% are considered between EF-0 and EF-1, with about 95% below EF-3. Only .01% of tornadoes reach the highest category of EF-5. Even so, they can cause many fatalities and significant property damage. \n\nWith information available as recently as 2013, tornadoes cause an average of 94-110 fatalities per year, depending on the source of data. Property damage caused by tornadoes is incredibly difficult to calculate, and as such, little current information about damages per state exists. \n\nThe best estimation we have about property damage is from insurance claims, and it is still unclear how much damage was caused by tornadoes rather than coterminous weather. On average, tornadoes cause about $6.5 billion in damages across the entire U.S., with peak years reaching close to $14.5 billion in damages.

Regulations are set on both the federal and state level and must be adhered to. It is common to see weigh stations along interstates for the purpose of weighing trucks to make sure that they are within the limitations.\r\n\r\nThere are a few reasons that trucks have weight limitations on roads and need to be properly weighed. The main reason is safety. Roads can only handle a certain amount of weight, especially in weaker spots such as bridges and overpasses; therefore, no vehicle can be over the weight limit of the weakest point on the road. Additionally, cargo that is too heavy can be dangerous to both the driver and other vehicles on the road. A truck that is carrying too much weight can make it difficult to brake and maneuver, posing a danger when trying to slow down or go down a hill. \r\n\r\nThe other two reasons for weighing trucks are taxes and profitability. Carriers pay taxes for the amount of stress put on the roads, and the weight of the trucks is used to calculate the taxes owed. As for profitability, many goods are valued based on their weight; therefore, weight is important in ensuring fair trade and increasing profits.\r\n\r\nThere are three different weights for trucks regulated by each state. The first is the maximum gross vehicle weight is the weight of the vehicle specified by the manufacturer including its chassis, body, engine, engine fluids, accessories, drivers, passengers and cargo. The maximum single axle weight is the amount of weight allowed on any one axle. The maximum tandem axle weight is the weight allowed on any tandem axle. \r\n\r\nTrucks can be weighed by using wheel-weighers, concrete decks, portable truck scales, digital scales and more. Trucks that are found to be overweight at a weigh stations can face several consequences including paying fines up to $65 per pound overweight and, in some states, arresting the driver. It is important that each truck is weighed before departing on its route to avoid these repercussions.\r\n\r\nThe federal vehicle weight limits are 80,000 pounds gross vehicle weight, 20,000 pounds on a single axle, and 34,000 pounds on a tandem axle group.

Possibly youâre pursuing a divorce, and youâre seeking proof of an affair or illegal activities. Perhaps youâre working with creditors, and you want to record your conversations. You might not think twice about hitting record on your recording device or mobile app, but did you know that what youâre doing might be illegal?\n\nEach state has its laws surrounding the recording of phone calls. In some states, there are single-party consent laws. This means that just one party has to consent to the recording. In other words, as long as one person knows the conversation is being recorded, it can be recorded without alerting the other party.\n\nIn other states, however, there are two-party consent laws. The name of the law is a bit misleading, however. Under two-party consent laws, every party must consent to the recording, even if there are more than two. This prevents you from recording someone without their knowledge. Itâs important to note that recording police officers or other public officials may have different laws based on the state in which you are recording.\n\nAs of January 2019, there are 11 states with two-party consent laws in place. These states are:\n\n- California\n- Connecticut\n- Florida\n- Hawaii\n- Illinois\n- Maryland\n- Massachusetts\n- Montana\n- New Hampshire\n- Pennsylvania\n- Washington\n\nIn some states, there are exceptions to the law.

The UBE offers portability of scores across states lines, and consists of three parts: the Multistate Bar Examination (MBE), the Multistate Essay Examination (MEE), and the Multistate Performance Test (MPT). The MBE is weighted at 50%, the MEE at 30%, and the MPT at 20%.\r\n\r\nThe bar exam is an examination administered in each state to assess a candidateâs knowledge and skills to determine whether or not the candidate is competent to practice law in that jurisdiction.  It was created in Delaware in 1738, and soon other states followed suit. Like the bar exam, the Uniform Bar Exam is administered twice a year over the course of two days, once in February and once in July, and is uniformly administered and scored. The UBE differs in that it can also be used to apply in multiple jurisdictions that have adopted the UBE. \r\n\r\nThe Uniform Bar Exam was first administered in 2011 in Missouri and North Dakota. Other states began to use the UBE gradually, with a total of 33 jurisdictions (31 states, the District of Columbia and the U.S. Virgin Islands) using the UBE. These states are:\r\n\r\n- Alabama \r\n- Alaska\r\n- Arizona\r\n- Colorado\r\n- Connecticut\r\n- District of Columbia\r\n- Idaho\r\n- Illinois\r\n- Iowa\r\n- Kansas\r\n- Maine\r\n- Maryland\r\n- Massachusetts\r\n- Minnesota\r\n- Missouri\r\n- Montana\r\n- Nebraska\r\n- New Hampshire\r\n- New Jersey\r\n- New Mexico\r\n- New York\r\n- North Carolina \r\n- North Dakota\r\n- Oregon\r\n- Rhode Island\r\n- South Carolina\r\n- Tennessee\r\n- Utah\r\n- Vermont\r\n- Washington\r\n- West Virginia\r\n- Wyoming\r\n- U.S. Virgin Islands\r\n\r\nThree states will soon adopt the UBE: Arkansas will adopt the UBE in February 2020; Ohio in July 2020; and Texas in February 2021. \r\n\r\nSome of the largest legal markets in the United States, including California and Florida, have not adopted the UBE, for reasons such as concerns about the lack of questions on state law. \r\n\r\nA person who passes the Uniform Bar Exam can transfer scores to another jurisdiction within a certain number of months of passing the exam.

The unemployment rate is reported every month by the [U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)](https://www.bls.gov/web/laus/laumstrk.htm). \n\nThe unemployment rate is not only a measure of the economyâs strength but also a measure of the overall happiness and wellbeing of U.S. citizens. Long-term unemployment is a burden for many and can cause financial, emotional, and psychological ruin. A personâs ability to provide for themselves and their family, pay their bills, and contribute to society are key factors in maintaining a happy life and cultural wellbeing. \n\nThere are three types of unemployment, all of which help explain why there is unemployment at a given time. \n\n-\tFrictional unemployment is caused by temporary transitions people make when moving to a new location, entering or re-entering the workforce, or switching from one job to another in search of better pay or a better fit of their skills. Frictional unemployment is also caused by employers laying off or hesitating to hire employees for reasons unrelated to the economy.\n-\tStructural unemployment happens when there is a mismatch in the demographic or industrial composition of a local economy. This happens when new technology causes a decline in older industries, which must then lay off workers to stay competitive. Outsourcing is also a part of structural unemployment. \n-\tCyclical unemployment occurs when there is not enough demand for goods and services in the economy at large to provide jobs for everyone. This is a natural result of capitalism.\n\nAs of December 2019, the national unemployment rate is 3.6%. The unemployment rate varies between states, ranging from 2.30% to 6.10%. In general, the current unemployment rates in the states are lower than they were in 2018, with only a few exceptions. \n\nAlaska has the highest unemployment rate of 6.10%. This, however, is lower than its 2018 unemployment rate of 7.30%. Alaska is in a statewide recession and has seen the fastest rate of job losses since 2015. The higher unemployment rates can be attributed to the seasonality of jobs, the natural frictional unemployment, and the population that lives a subsistence lifestyle.\n\nMississippi and the District of Columbia also have considerably high unemployment rates at 5.3% and 5.0% respectively. While Mississippiâs unemployment rate has dropped over the past few years, its labor force participation rate is only 55.9%, meaning that a little over half of the stateâs eligible workers are active in the economy. In D.C., black residents are six times as likely to be unemployed than their white counterparts, with unemployment rates for each group being 11.3% and 1.9% respectively.  \n\nSouth Carolina, Utah, and Vermont are tied for having the lowest unemployment rate of 2.30%. South Carolinaâs unemployment rate hit four historic lows from September 2019 to December 2019, decreasing from 2.9% to 2.3%. In addition to seeing a low unemployment rate, Utah has also seen the fastest rate of job growth in 2019 of any state, which was up 3.2% vs. the national average of 1.5%. Vermont business owners, like business owners in other states with low unemployment rates, consider the low unemployment rate to a problem as they are quickly growing and will have trouble finding qualified workers, resulting in lower production and cutting back on business hours. \n\nBelow is each stateâs unemployment rate for December 2019.

The Union, also known as the North, referred to the states that were part of the United States under President Lincolnâs government. The Union was also referred to as the âFederalsâ and the âYankees.â\r\n\r\nThe Union was made up of the 20 free states at the time and five Border states that supported the Union. Free states were states in which the slave trade was illegal. \r\n\r\n#### The Civil War\r\nThe Civil War would answer two questions about the United States: if the U.S. would be a collection of divided sovereign states or of unified states with a sovereign national government and if the country would continue to be the largest slaveholding country in the world. \r\n\r\nThe war started because of the free states and slave states were uncompromising in their differences on whether the government should prohibit slavery in new territories. When Abraham Lincoln was elected in 1860, he pledged to keep slavery out of the territories, which lead seven slave states to secede. These seven states formed the Confederate States of America: South Carolina, Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, and Texas.  \r\n\r\nThe war began on April 12, 1861 when the Confederate army opened fire at Fort Sumter. Following this, four more slave states seceded and joined the Confederacy: Virginia, Arkansas, Tennessee, and North Carolina. \r\n\r\nThe Union Army was a new formation comprised mostly of state units. The Border states were essential for winning the war, acting as supply bases for when the Union Army would invade the Confederacy. The Midwest states provided soldiers, horses, funds, and training camps. The Northwest and upper Midwest states provided industrial resources, such as large quantities of munitions and supplies, as well as funds for the war. \r\n\r\nBy 1865, all of the principal Confederate armies surrendered after the Union Army captured Confederate President Jefferson Davis. Following this, the war ended and the United States began rebuilding as a unified nation free of slavery. \r\n\r\n#### Union States\r\nThe term âUnionâ is used in the Constitution, ratified in the name of âWe the People of the United States, in Order to form a perfect Union...â Using the term âUnionâ carried a sense of legitimacy for the non-secessionist states in contrast to the Confederate states. The Union never saw the Confederate statesâ secession as legitimate and always considered them to be a part of the United States throughout their secession and the war. \r\n\r\nThe Union states had more size and strength than the South. The Union states included the Northeast, which was industrialized and urbanized, providing more vital resources and manpower than the Confederacy.\r\n\r\nUnion states in the West/Northwest:\r\n-\tCalifornia\r\n-\tNevada\r\n-\tOregon\r\n\r\nUnion states in the Midwest:\r\n-\tIllinois\r\n-\tIndiana\r\n-\tIowa\r\n-\tKansas\r\n-\tMichigan\r\n-\tMinnesota\r\n-\tOhio\r\n-\tWisconsin\r\n\r\nUnion states in the Northeast:\r\n-\tConnecticut\r\n-\tMaine\r\n-\tMassachusetts\r\n-\tNew Hampshire\r\n-\tNew Jersey\r\n-\tNew York\r\n-\tRhode Island\r\n-\tPennsylvania\r\n-\tVermont\r\n\r\nBorder States:\r\n-\tDelaware\r\n-\tKentucky\r\n-\tMaryland\r\n-\tMissouri\r\n-\tWest Virginia\r\n","data":{"customMeta":{"relatedArticles":["job-growth-by-state","at-will-employment-states","employment-rate-by-state","right-to-work-states","livable-wage-by-state","minimum-wage-by-state","nursing-compact-states","mpre-scores-by-state","union-states"]}},"lastModified":"2020-04-06T20:09:05.176Z","path":"union-states","name":"Union States"},{"article":"The literacy rate is the total number of literate persons (people able to both read and write) in a given age group, expressed as the percentage of that age group.

Non-U.S.-born adults comprise 34% of the U.S. population with low literacy skills. \r\n\r\nLiteracy rates [vary greatly by state](https://247wallst.com/special-report/2018/09/07/most-and-least-literate-states/6/) and are affected by several factors. \r\n\r\nNew Hampshire has the lowest percentage (5.8%) of adults lacking basic prose literacy skills, making New Hampshireâs literacy rate 94.2%. About 36.6% of adults in New Hampshire have a bachelorâs degree or higher, the seventh-highest rate in the country, and 60.8% of the population are registered library users, also the seventh-highest in the country.\r\n\r\nMinnesota has the second-highest literacy rate of 94.0%, with only 6% of adults lacking basic prose literacy skills. About 69.9% of Minnesota residents are registered library users, the second-highest in the country. \r\n\r\nNorth Dakota has the third-highest literacy rate of 93.7%, with 6.3% of adults lacking basic prose literacy skills. North Dakota, however, has the lowest percentage of registered library users of 35.9%.\r\n\r\nVermont has the fourth-highest literacy rate of 93.4%, with 6.6% of adults lacking basic prose literacy skills. Vermont has the highest number of libraries per 100,000 people of 29.8 and has the eighth-highest bachelorâs degree or higher attainment of 36.4%.\r\n\r\nSouth Dakota has the fifth-highest literacy rate of 93.0%, with 7.0% of adults lacking basic prose literacy skills. South Dakota has 16.4 public libraries per 100,000 residents, the fifth-highest in the country.\r\n\r\nCaliforniaâs 23.1% of adults lacking basic prose literacy skills make California have the lowest literacy rate of 76.9%. The state of California and the state Department of Education are being blamed and sued for the failing literacy rate, as families and students believe that they are not receiving a quality education in reading and writing.    \r\n\r\nNew York has the second-highest percentage of adults lacking basic prose literacy skills of 22.1%, equaling a literacy rate of 77.9%.  Despite this, New York has the ninth-highest percentage of adults with bachelorâs degrees or higher of 35.7%.\r\n\r\nFlorida has the third-highest percentage of adults lacking basic prose literacy skills of 19.7%, equaling a literacy rate of 80.3%. Florida has the lowest number f public libraries per 100,000 residents of 2.6.\r\n\r\nTexas has the fourth-lowest literacy rate of 81.0% with 19.0% of adults lacking basic prose literacy skills. Texas has the fourth-lowest number of libraries of 3.2 per 100,000 residents.\r\n\r\nThe fifth-lowest literacy rate in the United States is in New Jersey, where 16.9% of adults lack basic prose literacy skills and 83.1% are literate. Despite this, 38.6% of adults have a bachelorâs degree or higher, the fifth-highest in the country. \r\n","data":{"customMeta":{"relatedArticles":["abortion-rates-by-state","autism-rates-by-state","birth-rate-by-state","cancer-rates-by-state","circumcision-rates-by-state","corporate-tax-rates-by-state","crime-rate-by-state","depression-rates-by-state","employment-rate-by-state","flu-rates-by-state","infant-mortality-rate-by-state","labor-force-participation-rate-by-state","maternal-mortality-rate-by-state","murder-rate-by-state","obesity-rate-by-state","smoking-rates-by-state","state-tax-rates","suicide-rates-by-state","teen-pregnancy-rates-by-state","unemployment-rate-by-state","us-literacy-rates-by-state","vaccination-rates-by-state"]}},"lastModified":"2020-04-06T20:09:05.176Z","path":"us-literacy-rates-by-state","name":"Us Literacy Rates By State"},{"article":"","data":{"customMeta":{"relatedArticles":["civil-war-casualties-by-state","wwii-casualties-by-state","va-benefits-by-state"]}},"lastModified":"2020-04-06T20:09:05.176Z","path":"va-benefits-by-state","name":"Va Benefits By State"},{"article":"Vaccination is the administration of a vaccine to help the immune system develop protection from disease. Vaccines contain a weakened microorganism or virus, or proteins or toxins from an organism, not strong enough to infect someone but to help build a tolerance to the disease.\r\n\r\nUnlike in some countries around the world, vaccines are easily accessible in the United States. The seasonal influenza vaccine, or flu shot, is often offered for little to no cost at clinics across the United States every year during flu season. Many of these wide-available vaccines are for some of the most aggressive contagions that can be particularly harmful to children, the elderly, and people with autoimmune disease. Vaccines not only protect the individual receiving the vaccine, but also the community preventing the spread of these diseases.\r\n\r\nAround the world, more and more people are receiving life-saving vaccines. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has a thorough [list of vaccines](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/vaccines-list.html) used in the United States. An emphasis is placed on children between the ages of zero to 10 to receive a specific list of vaccines: hepatitis A (HepA); hepatitis B (HepB); diphtheria, tetanus, and acellular pertussis (DTaP); Hib, PCV13; inactivated poliovirus (IPV); inactivated influenza (IIV) or live-attenuated influenza (LAIV); measles, mumps, rubella (MMR); and varicella (VAR). \r\n\r\nWhile there are no federal laws regarding the requirement of vaccinations, all 50 states have legislation requiring children attending public school to be vaccinated against diphtheria, tetanus, and acellular pertussis (DTaP); polio (IPV); measles and rubella (MMR); and varicella (chickenpox). All states and the District of Columbia, however, allow medical exemptions for children who have a medical condition preventing them from receiving a vaccine. \r\n\r\nAccording to the [American Academy of Pediatrics]( https://www.aap.org/en-us/advocacy-and-policy/aap-health-initiatives/immunizations/Pages/Across-America.aspx), routine immunizations for children are vital for both individual and society health. Because immunization rates vary from state to state, some communities have recently experienced outbreaks of preventable diseases due to a lack of vaccinations. Low vaccination rates can be affected by medical exemptions, parentsâ choice (anti-vaccination movement), or by lack of health care or health insurance.\r\n\r\nThe ten states with the highest rates of childhood vaccinations are:\r\n\r\n1.\tMassachusetts (92.60%)\r\n2.\tVirginia (92.10%)\r\n3.\tMaine (88.30%)\r\n4.\tNew Hampshire (87.80%)\r\n5.\tRhode Island (87.50%)\r\n6.\tDelaware (87.20%)\r\n7.\tTennessee (86.70%)\r\n8.\tNorth Dakota (86.10%)\r\n9.\tNebraska (85.70%)\r\n10.\tNew Mexico (85.70%)\r\n\r\nMassachusetts has the highest vaccination rates in the United States. [According to the director](https://www.wickedlocal.com/news/20160922/vaccination-rates-in-massachusetts-among-highest-in-us) of the Massachusetts Department of Public Healthâs immunization program, it is likely attributed to the facts that the state has a strong provider network and most children receive care in a primary care practitioner office. Additionally, âMassachusetts has had essentially universal healthcare for children longer than whatâs been happening nationally.â\r\n\r\nAlaska has the lowest vaccination rate in the United States.

Nonetheless, they still carry the same amount of disadvantages as cigarettes. This fact is why they also have various rules and restrictions around their use in all states. With that said, here are the vaping laws that are in effect throughout the country. \n\n## Packaging\nBefore, vaping products were simple for the youth to access and use. After the government decided to fix this growing problem, they also wanted to change the way vaping products were packaged.\n\nSeveral states have already imposed a packaging system for these products to warn of the danger it can impose on those who use them. They are also there to remind the buyer that children cannot use the products.\n\nCurrently, there are 29 states with specific laws around how to package vaping products. They make sure that each packaged product has the necessary precautions to prevent children from accessing them, like:\n\n- Including the danger of using the product.\n- Reminding the buyer that the product isnât for children.\n- Making sure that all caps on products are tightly secured.\n- Wrapping all products securely and tightly.\n\n## Taxation\nDue to the effects vaping has had on people, especially teenagers, many states have imposed a tax on anyone of age purchasing e-cigarettes and vaping pens. As of December 2019, 21 states have decided to add this tax to vaping products. Massachusetts will be the latest state to impose this tax on June 1, 2020.\n\nEach state comes up with the tax rate to use in one of three ways:\n\n- Percentage of the price of the product.\n- Flat rate per milliliter of e-liquid/cartridge.\n- Using a combination of the first two approaches.\n\n## Youth Access\nRecently, there has been a problem with younger children and teenagers using e-cigarettes and vaping pens. This circumstance has resulted in many unfortunate events, such as nicotine addiction, health issues, and death.\n\nTo effectively fix this problem, all 51 states and districts decided to make it harder for the youth to access these vaping products. As of December 2019, each state throughout the country has raised the age needed to purchase any vaping products. However, some states raised their ages differently from others.\n\n- Age raised to 18: 27 states\n- Age raised to 19: 5 states\n- Age raised to 21: 19 states\n\n## Licensing\nFor some states, stores must be licensed to sell vaping products. This is because they require professionals to handle and sell any vaping products that may be on the market. Itâs also one way to tell who is authorized to process any vaping products and who isnât.\n\nMultiple states have passed laws that require convenience stores to have licenses or permits to sell these products. In fact, as of December 2019, 29 states have adopted this law, making this a requirement. This law means that with their license or permit, they can sell, refill, and distribute:\n\n- Vaping liquid\n- Vape pens\n- Vaping cartridges\n- E-cigarettes\n","lastModified":"2020-04-20T13:36:55.346Z","path":"vaping-laws-by-state","name":"Vaping Laws By State"},{"article":"Voter identification laws in the United States require that a person wishing to vote must provide some form of official identification before being permitted to register to vote, receiving a ballot or to cast their vote in elections. \r\n\r\nSupporters of voter ID laws argue that they reduce electoral fraud without placing a big burden on voters. Opponents of voter id laws argue that electoral fraud is extremely rare and that these laws often put up unnecessary barriers for minority groups and those less likely to possess photo IDs.\r\n\r\nAccording to the [National Conference of State Legislature](http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/voter-id.aspx), voter ID laws can be categorized in two ways:\r\n\r\n-\tWhether the state asks for a photo ID or accepts a non-photo ID\r\n-\tWhat actions are available for voters who do not have an ID\r\n\r\nPhoto ID states require voters to show documentation that has a photo such as a driverâs license, passport, state-issued identification card, military ID, tribal ID, etc. Non-photo ID states accept forms of identification without photos, such as bank statements with a name and address.\r\n\r\nIf a voter does not have identification, states provide alternatives. These laws are either considered strict or non-strict. Strict laws state that voters without acceptable identification must vote on a provisional ballot and take additional steps after Election Day in order for their vote to be counted. Non-strict laws state that some voters without acceptable identification have the option to cast a ballot will be counted without further action taken by the voter.\r\n\r\nThirty-five states have laws requesting or requiring voters to show some form of identification at the election polls.

Whether they just havenât registered, donât care about politics, donât like any of the candidates, or have some other reason, there are many people that donât show up at the polls come election day. \n\nIn this article, weâre going to explore the total voter turnout by state. For the purposes of this article, weâre going to focus on the percentage of people by state that showed up for the last presidential election.

Maine and Colorado were also at the top of the list for highest voter turnout, with 70.70% and 70% voting in the presidential election, respectively. \n\nWhen it comes to the lowest voter turnout, Hawaii ranked last with a turnout of just 42.3%.

Welfare programs typically provide either a free or subsidized supply of certain goods and services such as healthcare and education.\r\n\r\nThe United States has six major welfare programs: Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Programs (SNAP), Supplemental Security Income, Earned Income Tax Credit, Housing Assistance, and Medicaid. These six welfare programs are not to be confused with the four entitlement programs: Social Security, Medicare, unemployment insurance, and workerâs compensation. \r\n\r\nWelfare recipients in the United States must prove their income falls below a certain target based on the federal poverty level in order to qualify. In April 2018, President Trump signed an executive order directing federal agencies to review work requirements for TANF, Medicaid, SNAP, and housing assistance. Childless SNAP recipients who do not have disabilities, for example, must find a job within three months or lose their benefits. \r\n\r\nThe number of SNAP recipients has decreased overall in most states, as can be seen in the table below. The number of recipients grew during 2007-2011 due to the recession and has seen a steady decline since, most likely because of an improving economy and the imposed three-month limit. \r\n\r\nThe ten states that have the highest number of SNAP recipients are:\r\n\r\n1.\tCalifornia (3,636,314)\r\n2.\tTexas (3,291,843)\r\n3.\tFlorida (2,779,400)\r\n4.\tNew York (2,642,450)\r\n5.\tIllinois (1,780,778)\r\n6.\tPennsylvania (1,741,489)\r\n7.\tOhio (1,378,556)\r\n8.\tGeorgia (1,348,973)\r\n9.\tMichigan (1,167,928)\r\n10.\tTennessee (891,135)\r\n\r\nBelow is a table of each stateâs number of SNAP recipients for 2018 and 2019.\r\n","data":{"states":[],"customMeta":{"note":"* Official program name is Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).

Wine is created by yeast consumes the sugar in the grapes and converts it to ethanol, carbon dioxide, and heat. There are many different styles of wine, such as red, white, and rosÃ©, depending on the grapes and strains of yeast used to make them. Less commonly, wine is also made from other fruits, such as plum, cherry, currant, elderberry, and pomegranate (fruit wine) or rice (rice wine). \r\n\r\nWine is fat free and contains no cholesterol. A 4-ounce glass of wine has about 80-100 calories in it. Studies have shown that moderate red wine consumption can benefit the human body due to the antioxidant content founding the wine. These antioxidants can lower incidences of cardiovascular disease, mortality, and type-2 diabetes. \r\n\r\nWine is made in just about every country in the world. The worldâs top producers of wine are Italy, France, Spain, China, and the United States. \r\n\r\nThe United States produces over 800 million gallons of wine per year, making it the fourth-largest wine-producing country in the world. The winemaking industry in the United States is based almost entirely on the cultivation of the European grape Vitis vinifera. The history of wine production in the United States start in the 16th century when European settlers made wine in Jacksonville, Florida using Scuppernong grapes. \r\n\r\nThere is a winery in every state in the U.S. Mississippi has the fewest wineries with 2 and California has the most with 4,391. Some states have more wineries than other states, but that does not necessarily mean they produce more wine. For example, Oregon produces less than wine than New York State, but have twice the number of wineries. \r\n\r\nThe ten states that produce the most wine in the U.S., and their share of total wine production) are:\r\n\r\n1.\tCalifornia (84.354%)\r\n2.\tWashington (5.053%)\r\n3.\tNew York (3.468%)\r\n4.\tPennsylvania (1.538%)\r\n5.\tOregon (1.466%)\r\n6.\tOhio (0.736%)\r\n7.\tMichigan (0.319%)\r\n8.\tKentucky (0.270%)\r\n9.\tVermont (0.269%)\r\n10.\tVirginia (0.268%)\r\n\r\nCalifornia is the largest wine producer in the United States, producing over 84% of all U.S. wine production. California has a total of 4,391 wineries located all over the state including in famous wine regions such as Napa Valley and Sonoma. Napa Valley is known for its Chardonnay, Merlot, and Cabernet Sauvignon, while Sonoma is known for its Pinot Noir, Cabernet Sauvignon, and Chardonnay. If California were a country, it would be the fourth-largest wine producer in the world behind France, Italy, and Spain. \r\n\r\nWashington State is the second-largest wine producer in the United States; however, it produces just a fraction of what California produces. Washington accounts for just over 5% of the total American wine production. Washingtonâs wine production began increasing rapidly starting in the 1960s, exporting wine to more than 40 countries around the world.  \r\n\r\nThe remaining 48 states produce less than 11% of the United States total wine production. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","data":{"customMeta":{"relatedArticles":["alcohol-consumption-by-state","alcohol-tax-by-state","dry-states","wine-production-by-state","drinking-age-by-state","beef-production-by-state","corn-production-by-state","oil-production-by-state"]}},"lastModified":"2020-04-06T20:09:05.176Z","path":"wine-production-by-state","name":"Wine Production By State"},{"article":"Have you ever been driving down the road when suddenly, youâre cut-off by a crazed driver? Maybe youâve had to slam on the brakes because the driver ahead of you failed to signal a turn, or perhaps youâve come close to getting into an accident because a distracted driver blew through a traffic signal. \n\nAnyone that has been a driver on the road has encountered a bad driver. Texting and other distracted driving, speeding, tailgating, and failure to obey signs and laws is not just an annoyance, but all of these factors can contribute to an auto accident. \n\nEncountering these events can lead you to believe that your state has the worst drivers. However, while there are bad drivers in all states, some states have an excessive number. One way that this has been measured is through a study conducted by SmartAsset. \n\nFor the 2019 study, SmartAsset evaluated four metrics to determine the states with the worst drivers. The first metric was the percentage of insured drivers within the state. The next metric was the number of DUI arrests per every thousand drivers. The third metric was the frequency of residents to use search engines to find terms including âspeeding ticketâ or âtraffic ticket.â Finally, the number of fatalities per 100,000 miles driven was also evaluated. \n\nBased on this information, SmartAsset found that five out of the top ten states with the worst drivers were located in the South. This includes the number one state for the worst drivers â Mississippi. \n\nMississippi took the top spot for worst drivers in the nation for two years in a row. This state has one of the lowest rates of insured drivers, a high search volume for driving-related tickets, and a high rate of fatalities. The state does have a fairly low number of DUIs. \n\nAnother southern state took the next highest spot. Alabama has a low percentage of insured drivers, a high number of fatalities, and a high rate of search engine searches for driving-related infractions. One positive thing is that this state does have quite a low rate of DUI incidents at 1.82 per 1,000 drivers. \n\nThe third state on the list is California. California has a high rate of searched for traffic-related tickets, a low percentage of insured drivers, and a high rate of DUI incidents. \n\nIn fourth place are three states â Florida, Nevada, and Texas. Florida has the lowest rate of insured drivers in the nation but a low DUI rate. Nevada has a high number of DUI rates and the highest rate of searched for traffic-related tickets. Texas has a high rate of searches for traffic tickets and a low percentage of insured drivers. \n\nOther states on this list to round out the top 10 states with the worst drivers are Arizona, Alaska, Tennessee, and Missouri. \n\n","data":{"states":[],"customMeta":{"columns":["state",{"header":"Bad Driving Index","field":"badDrivingIndex"},{"header":"Drivers

Is it a high crime rate, high poverty rate, lack of jobs, or something else? Some people may view a state with few urban areas and a low population as the worst state to live. Others may classify a state thatâs densely populated, with a high cost of living as the worst.\n\nAs you can see, thereâs not just one defining factor that makes a state a lousy place to live. However, some organizations and publications have created their lists based on various factors that give an overview of the worst states in the U.S. to live. For example, the U.S. News \u0026 World Report has its Best States ranking which looks at factors including education, health care, the economy, opportunities, quality of life, infrastructure, and public safety. The report gives weight to certain elements over others based on what matters most to citizens. For example, health care and education hold the most weight, as these are factors that are most important to U.S. citizens.\n\nBased on the 2018 survey, Louisiana was ranked as the worst state to live. The state ranked worst in the nation for the opportunity and ranked 49th out of 50 for education. It ranked in the bottom 10 in other areas.\n\nThe next worst state as determined by this report was Mississippi, which ranked 50th in the nation in health care. It also ranked 49th in infrastructure and opportunity.\n\nComing in as the third worst state in the nation is New Mexico. This was ranked as the worst in the country in terms of education and was ranked 49th for crime and corrections.\n\nThe top 10 worst states based on this report were:\n\n- Louisiana\n- Mississippi\n- New Mexico\n- West Virginia\n- Alabama\n- Arkansas\n- Alaska\n- Oklahoma\n- South Carolina\n- Kentucky\n\nThis isnât the only report, however. CNBC also took a look at its Quality of Life category in its Americaâs Top States for Business report to rank the worst states in the nation. Factors including attractions, health care, quality of the environment, and violent crime rates were evaluated to create this list. Based on these factors, CNBC determined the worst states to live in to be:\n\n- Arkansas\n- Louisiana\n- Alabama\n- Tennessee\n- Indiana\n- Missouri\n- Oklahoma\n- South Carolina\n- Mississippi\n- New Mexico\n","data":{"states":["Louisiana","Mississippi","New Mexico","West Virginia","Alabama","Arkansas","Alaska","Oklahoma","South

Oneâs dream spot, however, might not be realistic or within their means. And while everyoneâs preferences for retirement are different there are states considered to be the âbestâ and âworstâ for retirement. \r\n\r\nThe cost of living is a big factor for retirement, as it varies greatly between states. Additionally, crime rate, weather, health care, and whether or not the state taxes Social Security benefits are all taken into consideration when finding the ideal place to retire.\r\n\r\nThe largest factor of these, and arguably the most significant, is the annual spending for comfortable retirement (the cost of living) in each state. \r\n\r\nBased on this factor, the top ten worst states to retire in are:\r\n\r\n1.\tHawaii\r\n2.\tDistrict of Columbia\r\n3.\tCalifornia\r\n4.\tNew York\r\n5.\tMassachusetts\r\n6.\tMaryland\r\n7.\tOregon\r\n8.\tAlaska\r\n9.\tConnecticut\r\n10.\tRhode Island\r\n\r\nNot surprisingly, this list is very similar to the [most expensive states to live in]( http://worldpopulationreview.com/states/most-expensive-states-to-live-in/).\r\n\r\nHawaii is considered to be the worst state to retire in. The annual spending for comfortable retirement in Hawaii is the highest of all 50 states at $117,724.18 per year. While the weather might be beautiful and the thought of an island retirement sounds ideal to many people, Hawaii is one of the most expensive states to both live and retire in.\r\n\r\nThe District of Columbia follows Hawaii with annual spending for comfortable retirement of $100,879.90 per year. Hawaii and Washington DC are the only two states with annual spending for comfortable retirement above $100,000. \r\n\r\nIf one were to base their retirement location entirely on the lowest cost of living, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Missouri, and Michigan would be the best options. \r\n\r\nBelow is a table of each stateâs annual spending for comfortable retirement.\r\n","data":{"states":[],"customMeta":{"columns":["state",{"header":"Annual Spending for Comfortable Retirement","field":"retirementCost","format":"moneyWithCurrency"},"population"],"sortAsc":false,"sortField":"retirementCost","showAllStates":true,"chloroMap":{"thresholds":["min",56000,60000,65000,70000,85000,"max"],"field":"retirementCost"},"relatedArticles":["best-states-for-education","best-states-for-gun-owners","best-states-for-teachers","best-states-to-live-in","best-states-to-raise-a-family","best-states-to-retire","states-with-the-best-weather","worst-drivers-by-state","worst-states-to-live-in","worst-states-to-retire"]},"customData":[{"state":"Alabama","retirementCost":55425.11},{"state":"Alaska","retirementCost":80877.32},{"state":"Arizona","retirementCost":60503.17},{"state":"Arkansas","retirementCost":54743.91},{"state":"California","retirementCost":85893.44},{"state":"Colorado","retirementCost":65333.51},{"state":"Connecticut","retirementCost":79762.62},{"state":"Delaware","retirementCost":65643.15},{"state":"District of Columbia","retirementCost":100879.9},{"state":"Florida","retirementCost":61246.3},{"state":"Georgia","retirementCost":56477.88},{"state":"Hawaii","retirementCost":117724.18},{"state":"Idaho","retirementCost":58335.71},{"state":"Illinois","retirementCost":59264.62},{"state":"Indiana","retirementCost":55796.68},{"state":"Iowa","retirementCost":56849.45},{"state":"Kansas","retirementCost":55548.97},{"state":"Kentucky","retirementCost":56849.45},{"state":"Louisiana","retirementCost":57964.14},{"state":"Maine","retirementCost":72579.03},{"state":"Maryland","retirementCost":81310.81},{"state":"Massachusetts","retirementCost":82859},{"state":"Michigan","retirementCost":55301.26},{"state":"Minnesota","retirementCost":62856.41},{"state":"Mississippi","retirementCost":53071.87},{"state":"Missouri","retirementCost":54991.62},{"state":"Montana","retirementCost":64404.6},{"state":"Nebraska","retirementCost":57778.36},{"state":"Nevada","retirementCost":67067.48},{"state":"New Hampshire","retirementCost":67686.76},{"state":"New Jersey","retirementCost":75861.19},{"state":"New Mexico","retirementCost":57468.72},{"state":"New York","retirementCost":84035.62},{"state":"North Carolina","retirementCost":58211.85},{"state":"North Dakota","retirementCost":61122.44},{"state":"Ohio","retirementCost":57468.72},{"state":"Oklahoma","retirementCost":54558.13},{"state":"Oregon","retirementCost":81248.88},{"state":"Pennsylvania","retirementCost":61060.52},{"state":"Rhode Island","retirementCost":75861.19},{"state":"South Carolina","retirementCost":60874.73},{"state":"South Dakota","retirementCost":60998.59},{"state":"Tennessee","retirementCost":55425.11},{"state":"Texas","retirementCost":56539.81},{"state":"Utah","retirementCost":60812.81},{"state":"Vermont","retirementCost":73507.94},{"state":"Virginia","retirementCost":63166.05},{"state":"Washington","retirementCost":67810.61},{"state":"West Virginia","retirementCost":58645.34},{"state":"Wisconsin","retirementCost":59326.55},{"state":"Wyoming","retirementCost":56044.39}]},"sources":[{"name":"The Worst States for Retirement in 2019","link":"https://moneywise.com/a/the-worst-states-for-your-retirement-in-2019"}],"lastModified":"2020-04-06T20:09:05.180Z","path":"worst-states-to-retire","name":"Worst States To Retire"},{"article":"World War II, which lasted from 1939 to 1945, was the largest and deadliest military conflict in history.

The Axis Powers consisted of Germany, Italy, and Japan and grew out of these three nationâs own expansionist interests in the mid-1930s. \r\n\r\nIt is believed that casualties from the war ranged anywhere between 70 million and 85 million people, 50-55 million of which were civilians and 21-25 million of which were military deaths. Germany is estimated to have the highest number of casualties from the war between 6.6 million and 8.8 million, which is possibly over 10% of total casualties. \r\n\r\nAbout 16 million U.S. servicemembers served in World War II, about 11% of the total United States population in 1940. 350,000 women served in the U.S. Armed Forces at home and abroad. About 38.8% (6,332,000) of U.S. servicemen and servicewomen in WWII were volunteers and 61.2% were draftees (11,535,000). About 73% of servicemen and servicewomen served overseas for an average duration of 16 months. Combat survivability rates were as follow:\r\n\r\n-\tKilled in action: 8.6 per 1,000\r\n-\tNon-fatal combat wounds: 17.7 per 1,000\r\n-\tDied from other causes: 3 per 1,000 \r\n\r\nOf those that served, [there were about 416,800 casualties](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/natsec/RL32492.pdf). This includes those killed in action, died of wounds, died of injuries, died in non-battle, finding of death, missing, and in prison camps. \r\n\r\nThe states with the highest number of casualties:\r\n\r\n1. New York 41,401\r\n2. Pennsylvania 36,754\r\n3. California 31,040\r\n4. Illinois 27,568\r\n5.

name: The Effect of Large-Scale Anti-Contagion Policies on the Coronavirus (COVID-19)
  Pandemic
description: Governments around the world are responding to the novel coronavirus
  (COVID-19) pandemic with unprecedented policies designed to slow the growth rate
  of infections. Many actions, such as closing schools and restricting populations
  to their homes, impose large and visible costs on society. In contrast, the benefits
  of these policies, in the form of infections that did not occur, cannot be directly
  observed and are currently understood through process-based simulations. Here, we
  compile new data on local, regional, and national anti-contagion policies recently
  deployed in the ongoing pandemic across localities in China, South Korea, Iran,
  Italy, France, and the United States (US). We then apply reduced-form econometric
  methods, commonly used to measure the effect of policies on economic growth, to
  empirically evaluate the effect that these anti-contagion policies have had on the
  growth rate of infections. In the absence of any policy actions, we estimate that
  early infections of COVID-19 exhibit exponential growth rates of roughly 42% per
  day. We find that anti-contagion policies collectively have had significant effects
  slowing this growth. Our results suggest that similar policies may have different
  impacts on different populations, but we obtain consistent evidence that the policy
  packages now deployed are achieving large, beneficial, and measurable health outcomes.
  We estimate that, to date, current policies have already prevented or delayed on
  the order of 62 million infections across these six countries. These findings may
  help inform whether or when these ongoing policies should be lifted or intensified,
  and they can support decision-making in the other 180+ countries where COVID-19
  has been reported.
